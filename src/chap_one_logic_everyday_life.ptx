<introduction>
	<title>Chapter 1 Introduction</title>
	<p>
		In this chapter we'll learn several different tools. We'll look at logic, sets, Venn
		diagrams, percentages, rates and proportions. Then we'll work with a problem solving process
		that can be applied to many types of problems.
	</p>
</introduction>

<subsection>
<title>Logic</title>
	<p>
		<term>Logic</term> is the study of reasoning. Our goal in this chapter is to examine arguments to determine their validity and soundness. In this section we will look at propositions and logical connectors that are the building blocks of arguments. We will also use truth tables to help us examine complex statements.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Propositions</title>
	<p>
		A <term>proposition</term> is a complete sentence that is either true or false. Opinions can be propositions, but questions or phrases cannot.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Which of the following are propositions?
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						I am reading a math book.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Math is fun!
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Do you like turtles?
					</p>
				</li>
					<li>
					<p>
						My cat
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			The first and second items are propositions. The third one is a question and the fourth is a phrase, so they are not. We are not concerned right now about whether a statement is true or false. We will come back to that later when we examine full arguments.
		</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	<p>
		Arguments are made of one or more propositions (called <term>premises</term>), along with a <term>conclusion</term>. Propositions may be <term>negated</term>, or combined with <term>connectors</term> like “and”, and “or”. Let's take a closer look at how these negations and logical connectors are used to create more complex statements. 
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Negation (not)</title>
	<p>
		One way to change a proposition is to use its <term>negation</term>, or opposite meaning. We often use the word <q><term>not</term></q> to negate a statement.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Write the negation of the following propositions.
		<ol marker="a">
			<li>
				<p>
					I am reading a math book.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Math is fun!
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The sky is not green.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Cars have wheels.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
	</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						Negation: I am <insert>not</insert> reading a math book.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Negation: Math is <insert>not</insert> fun!
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Negation: The sky is green (or <insert>not</insert> not green).
					</p>
				</li>
					<li>
					<p>
						Negation: Cars do <insert>not</insert> have wheels.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

<subsection>
	<title>Negation of All and None</title>

	<p>
		It is worth mentioning these qualifiers and how to negate them. If we were to make the statement, <q><alert>All</alert> students read this book,</q> we could negate it by saying <q><alert>Not all</alert> students read this book.</q> or <q><alert>Some</alert> students <alert>don't</alert> read this book.</q> Notice how this is very different from <q><alert>No</alert> students read this book.</q>
	</p>
	<p>
		If we were to negate, <q><alert>No</alert> students read this book,</q> we could say, <q><alert>A</alert> student is reading this book,</q> or even, <q><alert>Some</alert> students do read this book.</q> It only takes one counterexample to negate an all or nothing statement and the phrases <alert>some do</alert> and <alert>some don't</alert> are often used for this purpose. The same concept applies to similar words like everyone, nobody, always and never.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Write two different negations of each statement.
			<ol marker="a">
			<li>
				<p>
					All college students take psychology.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Dogs are never brown.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
			<ol marker="a">
			<li>
				<p>
					Negations: <insert>Not</insert> all college students take psychology, or, <insert>Some</insert> college students <alert>don't</alert> take psychology.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Negations: <insert>There are</insert> brown dogs, or, <insert>Some</insert> dogs are brown.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Multiple Negations</title>

	<p>
		It is possible to use more than one negation in a statement. If you've ever said something like, <q>I <alert>can't not</alert> go,</q> you are saying you will go. In fact, it's often used for emphasis or a slightly different meaning, that you really must go. If someone says, <q>I <alert>don't disagree</alert>,</q> they may be saying they don't exactly agree but the person has a point. A <term>double negative</term> is similar to multiplying two negative numbers which gives a positive result. Using a third negation would then be equivalent to a single negation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that in some instances a negation word like <q>no,</q> <q>nobody,</q> or <q>nothing</q> is used to emphasize rather than negate and this is called <term>negative concord</term>. For example, <q>I ain't got no money,</q> is not a double negative but rather an emphasis of not having any money. This is common across many varieties of English and other languages. You can read more about negative concord at this <url href="https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/negative-concord" visual="ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/negative-concord">site</url>. In general, use your judgment and context cues to distinguish between a double negative and negative concord. We will use multiple negations but not negative concord in this book.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the media and in ballot measures we often see multiple negations and it can be confusing to figure out what a statement means.
	</p>

	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Read the statement and determine the outcome of a yes vote.
		</p>
		<p>
			<q>Vote for this measure to repeal the ban on plastic bags.</q>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				If you said that a yes vote would enable plastic bag usage, you are correct. The ban stopped plastic bag usage, so to repeal the ban would allow it again. This measure has a double negation and is also not very good for the environment.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Read the statement and determine the outcome on mandatory minimum sentencing.
		</p>
		<p>
			<q>The bill that overturned the ban on mandatory minimum sentencing was vetoed.</q>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				In this case mandatory minimum sentencing would not be allowed. The ban would stop it, and the bill to overturn it was vetoed. This is an example of a triple negation.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

<subsection>
	<title>Logical Connectors: <em>and</em> and <em>or</em></title>

	<p>
		When we use the word <q><term>and</term></q> between two propositions, it connects them to create a new statement that is also a proposition. For example, if you said <q>To finish this project, I need a screwdriver <alert>and</alert> a wrench,</q> then you are expressing the need for both tools. For an <q>and</q> statement to be true, the connected propositions must both be true. If even one proposition is false (for instance, you didn't need a wrench) then the entire connected statement is false.
	</p>
	<p>
		The word <q><term>or</term></q> between two propositions similarly connects the propositions to create a new statement. In this case, if you said <q>To finish this project, I need a screwdriver <alert>or</alert> a wrench,</q> then you are expressing the need for one of the tools (but probably not both). For an <q>or</q> statement to be true, at least one of the propositions must be true (or both could be true).
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Determine whether each compound statement is true or false.
		<ol marker="a">
			<li>
				<p>
					Guitars have strings and cats do not have whiskers.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Guitars have strings or cats do not have whiskers.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Whales are not mammals and spiders have ten legs.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Whales are not mammals or spiders have ten legs.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Six is an even number and Salem is the capital of Oregon.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Six is an even number or Salem is the capital of Oregon.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						False. Guitars have strings but cats do have whiskers. Both statements must be true for an <q>and</q> statement to be true.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						True. Since one of the parts is true, the <q>or</q> statement is true.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						False. Whales are mammals and spiders have eight legs, so both parts are false, making the <q>and</q> statement false.
					</p>
				</li>
					<li>
					<p>
						False. Neither of the parts are true, so the <q>or</q> statement is false.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						True. Six is even and Salem is the capital of Oregon. Since both parts are true, the <q>and</q> statement is true.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						True. Since both parts are true, the <q>or</q> statement is true.

<subsection>
	<title>Exclusive vs. Inclusive <em>Or</em></title>
	<p>
		In English we often mean for <em>or</em> to be <term>exclusive</term>: one or the other, but not both. In math, however, <em>or</em> is usually <term>inclusive</term>: one or the other, or both. The thing we are including, or excluding is the <q>both</q> option.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Determine whether each <em>or</em> statement is inclusive or exclusive.
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						Would you like a chicken or vegan meal?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						We want to hire someone who speaks Spanish or Chinese.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Are you going to wear sandals or tennis shoes?
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Are you going to visit Thailand or Vietnam on your trip?
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				The first <em>or</em> statement is a choice of one or the other, but not both, so it is exclusive. The second statement is inclusive because they could find a candidate who speaks both languages. The third statement is exclusive because you can't wear both at the same time. The fourth statement is inclusive because you could visit both countries on your trip.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Conditional Statements: <em>if, then</em></title>
	<p>
		A <term>conditional</term> statement connects two propositions with <em>if, then</em>. An example of a conditional statement would be <q><em>If</em> it is raining, <em>then</em> we'll go to the mall.</q> The first part (the <q><em>if</em></q> part) is called the <term>hypothesis</term> and the second part (the <q><em>then</em></q> part) is called the <term>conclusion</term>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The statement, <q>It is raining,</q> may be true or false for any given day. If the condition is true, then we will follow the course of action and go to the mall. If the condition is false, though, we haven't said anything about what we will or won't do.
	</p>
	<p>
	 	To understand the truth values for a conditional statement it is helpful to look at an example. Let's say a friend tells you, <q>If you post that photo to Facebook, you'll lose your job.</q> Under what conditions can you say that your friend was wrong?
	</p>
	<p>
	 	There are four possible outcomes:
	 	<ol>
	 		<li>
	 			<p>
	 				You post the photo and lose your job
	 			</p>
	 		</li>
	 		<li>
	 			<p>
	 				You post the photo and don't lose your job
	 			</p>
	 		</li>
	 		<li>
	 			<p>
	 				You don't post the photo and lose your job
	 			</p>
	 		</li>
	 		<li>
	 			<p>
	 				You don't post the photo and don't lose your job
	 			</p>
	 		</li>
	 	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	 	The only case where you can say your friend was wrong is the second case, in which you post the photo but still keep your job.
	</p>
	<p>
	 	Your friend didn't say anything about what would happen if you didn't post the photo, so you can't say the last two statements are wrong. Even if you didn't post the photo and lost your job anyway, your friend never said that you were guaranteed to keep your job if you didn't post it.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this case it can be useful to outline the possibilities and outcomes in a table. The four cases above correspond to the four rows of the truth table. For this table we will use P for <q>posting the photo,</q> and L for <q>losing your job.</q>
	</p>
		<tabular halign="center" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor">
			<row header="yes">
				<cell><em>Posting the Photo (P)</em></cell>
				<cell><em>Losing Your Job (L)</em></cell>
				<cell>If <em>P</em>, then <em>L</em></cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>You post the photo (T)</cell>
				<cell>You lose your job (T)</cell>
				<cell>True</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>You post the photo (T)</cell>
				<cell>You don't lose your job (F)</cell>
				<cell>False</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>You don't post the photo (F)</cell>
				<cell>You lose your job (T)</cell>
				<cell>True</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>You don't post the photo (F)</cell>
				<cell>You don't lose your job (F)</cell>
				<cell>True</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
	<!-- <p>
		Notice that the only outcome that is false is if you post the photo and don't lose your job. The other possibilities are all true.
	</p> -->
	<p>
		If the hypothesis (the <q>if</q> part) is false, we cannot say that the statement is a lie, so the result of the third and fourth rows is true. Notice that we are using a double negation in this explanation.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Determine whether each conditional statement is true or false.
		<ol marker="a">
			<li>
				<p>
					If tricycles have three wheels, then bicycles have two wheels.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					If tricycles have three wheels, then tricycles can fly.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					If pigs can fly, then birds can fly.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					If pigs can fly, then the sky is yellow.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						True. Tricycles have three wheels and bicycles have two wheels. The hypothesis and conclusion are both true, so the statement is true.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						False. Tricycles have three wheels, but they cannot fly. The hypothesis is true but the conclusion is false, making the statement false.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						True. Pigs cannot fly (on their own) but birds can. Since the hypothesis is false, the statement is true regardless of whether the conclusion is true or false.
					</p>
				</li>
					<li>
					<p>
						True. Since the hypothesis is false, the statement is true regardless of whether the conclusion is true or false.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

<subsection>
	<title>Evaluating Compound Statements</title>
	<p>
		Some situations combine many <q>if, then</q>, <q>and</q> or <q>or</q> statements that may be inclusive or exclusive. Here's an example where we need to evaluate a complex statement.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Determine which set(s) of qualificaitons meet the requirement: <q>To apply for this job, applicants must have a bachelor's degree, an associate's degree and 3 years of relevant experience, or a high school diploma or GED and 6 years of relevant experience.</q>
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						Lyssa has a bachelor's degree and 2 years of relevant experience.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Jordan has a high school diploma and 3 years of relevant experience.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Ayan has an associate's degree and 6 years of relevant experience.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Sylvia has a GED and 6 years of relevant experience.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				There are many combinations that work here. Lyssa, Ayan and Sylvia all meet the requirements or go beyond what is needed. Jordan does not have enough years of experience to go with a high school diploma for this job.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>
		We are using the words <em>and, or, not</em> and <em>if then</em> in this book, but if you look up other resources on logic you are likely to see these symbols.

	<title>Logical Equivalence</title>
	<p>
		And and or statments can have their propositions reversed without affecting the truth value of the statement. If you need to buy bacon and eggs, that's the same as buying eggs and bacon. The order does matter for a conditional statement, though. Sometimes during an argument, an <em>if, then</em> statement will be reversed or combined with <em>not</em> in different ways. There are names for the combinations and it is helpful to look at which statements are equivalent to each other. Here are the names for the different combinations of an if, then and not statements.
	</p>
	<p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					<term> Original Conditional</term>: if p, then q
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<term>Converse</term>: if q, then p
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<term>Inverse</term>: if not p, then not q
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<term>Contrapositive</term>: if not q, then not p
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's look at all of the possibilities in an example.
	</p>
		
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Assume this original conditional statement is true: <q>If you take your dog to the park, they will be happy.</q> Write the converse, inverse and contrapositive of the original statement and determine which are equivalent to each other.
		</p>
	</statement>
	<solution>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Converse: <q>If your dog is happy, then you took them to the park.</q> Notice we needed to change the tense to keep the order of events the same. If your dog is happy does that mean you took them to the park? Not necessarily, because there are other reasons your dog could be happy like getting a treat or taking a walk. So this is false.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Inverse: <q>If you don't take your dog to the park, they will not be happy.</q> This is similar to the converse. Even if you don't take your dog to the park, they could be happy for another reason. This is false. The inverse is logically equivalent to the converse.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Contrapositive: <q>If your dog is not happy, then you did not take them to the park.</q> Since the original statement is true, then this is also true. Taking your dog to the park would result in them being happy, so if they are not happy we can say that they did not go to the park. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
	</solution>
	</example>
	<p>
		Let's summarize the results in this box.
	</p>
	<assemblage>
		<title>Logical Equivalence</title>
		<p>
			A <term>conditional</term> statement and its <term>contrapositive</term> are equivalent.

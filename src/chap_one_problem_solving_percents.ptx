	<p>
		Many important decisions in life can be made more effectively using quantitative information. The goal of this book and course is for you to feel more comfortable and confident with mathematical tools that are applicable to your life now and in the future. We will work with proportions for scaling and comparing quantities and  financial tools for managing money and taxes. We will also work with statistics for decisions that involve data, probability for decisions with uncertain events, and methods for fair group decision-making like apportionment and voting systems. By practicing with these tools, you'll be better equipped and feel more empowered to use mathematical tools to help you make decisions in college and beyond.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this chapter we'll learn several different tools for making decisions. We'll look at a problem solving structure, percentages, rates and proportions for comparisons, and logic, sets and Venn diagrams for grouping information.

<title>A Problem Solving Process</title>
	<p>
		In this section we will outline a problem solving process and see how number sense and operation sense tie into the process. As in real life, we focus on problems that have a trade-off or more than one right answer as much as possible.
	</p>
	<!-- <p>
		This section may be review for you, and it may present math in a different light that is more concrete and applied than math you have had previously. Our goal is to examine math problems that are relevant to your life where you can apply your lived experience. Some of these problems involve a trade-off or more than one right answer. First, we will outline a problem solving process and see how number sense and operation sense ties into the process. Then we will use percentages to compare quantities.
	</p> -->
	<p>
		There are many ways to write a problem solving process, and this is just one example. Some of the important elements are breaking down complex issues into manageable parts, following a logical reasoning process, and using creativity to consider all the possibilities. In real life, problem solving is often an iterative process so evaluation and refinement are important elements as well.

				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</assemblage>
		<p>
			Let's illustrate this process using an example of a decision you may need to make.
		</p>
		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					You're comparing two healthcare plans to select one of them for the next year. Plan A has a $200 monthly premium and a $1000 deductible, and plan B has a $150 monthly premium and a $2400 deductible. Which plan is more cost effective and why?
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many ways to approach a problem like this, so this is an example. Please feel free to try it on your own first before you click on or read our solution. In the online version we have a solution link for each step to reveal one step at a time. You'll see that we go through the steps more than once.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<title>Step 1: The question, context and estimation</title>
				<p>
					The question we need to answer is which plan is cheaper overall. We also need to make sure we understand all the insurance vocabulary used here.
					<ul>
						<li>
							A <term>premium</term> is the amount paid for the health insurance plan (usually monthly) and does not go toward any healthcare used.
						</li>
						<li>
							A <term>deductible</term> is the amount that a customer must pay of their healthcare used before the insurance company will start paying. <!-- Sometimes there are copays for services like office visits that are not subject to the deductible. -->
						</li>
					</ul>
					We estimate the yearly cost to be in the thousands for each plan. If we got an amount less than a thousand or more then $10,000 we would be surprised and double check our work.
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution>
				<title>Step 2: The information</title>
				<p>
					We are given the monthly premiums and deductibles for each plan. We will assume this is for one person. Most plans have a separate deductible for each person so making this decision for a family could be an extension of this problem. You might also need to know how much you usually spend on healthcare per year. We will proceed without this for now and return to this step if it becomes relevant. Let's restate the information we have:
				</p>
				<sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
					<p>
						Plan A:
						<ul marker = "disc">
							<li>
								<p>
								Premium: $200 per month
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
								Deductible: $1000 per year
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						Plan B:
						<ul marker = "disc">
							<li>
								<p>
								Premium: $150 per month
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
								Deductible: $2400 per year
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</sidebyside>
			</solution>
			<solution>
				<title>Step 3: Consider possible methods</title>
				<p>
					We could compare the two plans on a yearly basis, monthly basis, or make a table.
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution>
				<title>Step 4: Choose a method to continue</title>
				<p>
					Let's try calculating the cost of each plan per year.
				</p>
				<sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
					<stack>
					<p>
						Plan A:
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\$200\cdot12</m> months <m>=\$2400</m> per year for premiums.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then add <m>\$1000</m> for the deductible.
					</p>
					<p>
						The total cost is <m>\$2400 + \$1000 = \$3400</m> per year.
					</p>
					</stack>
					<stack>
					<p>
						Plan B:
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\$150\cdot12</m> months <m>=\$1800</m> per year for premiums.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then add <m>\$2400</m> for the deductible.
					</p>
					<p>
						The total cost is <m>\$1800 + \$2400 = \$4200</m> per year.
					</p>
					</stack>
				</sidebyside>
				<p>
					So Plan A is cheaper, right? Well, we bet you are thinking it depends.
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution>
				<title>Step 5: Check for a reasonable answer</title>
				<p>
					We double checked our math and total amount for each plan is within our original estimate. The totals are not too large or too small to make sense. However, there is another factor to consider. What if you don't use your whole deductible in a year? We noticed that the premiums alone are cheaper for Plan B, so if no healthcare is used during a year then Plan B would be cheaper.
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution>
				<title>Step 2 Again: Estimate missing information</title>
				<p>
					You could look back at your records and determine how much you usually spend on healthcare each year (the amount billed to insurance). You would also want to consider whether anything might be different in the coming year.
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution>
				<title>Step 3 Again: Consider possible methods</title>
				<p>
					We could try some values to see which plan was cheaper, and even find the billed amount that switches from Plan B being cheaper to Plan A being cheaper. In order to do this in a systematic way, we will make a table. It might be very useful to get a sense of the range of values where each plan is more cost effective.
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution>
				<title>Step 4 Again: Choose a method to continue</title>
				<p>
					To make a table, we will start with $0 in billed healthcare and go up from there. To be more efficient, we will start with increments of $200 and go smaller if needed. A spreadsheet would also be a great tool for this. We will learn about and use spreadsheets in the financial math chapter.
				</p>
				<p>
					To fill in our table we will use the same calculation we did before and combine the two steps into one. For $0 in billed healthcare we have this calculation for each plan.
				</p>
				<sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
					<stack>
					<p>
						Plan A:
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\$200\cdot12+\highlight{0}=\$2400</m>
					</p>
					</stack>
					<stack>
					<p>
						Plan B:
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\$150\cdot12+\highlight{0}=\$1800</m>
					</p>
					</stack>
				</sidebyside>
				<p>
					Continuing that for each healthcare amount, we fill in this table:
				</p>
				<tabular row-headers="no" top="minor" left="minor" right="minor" bottom="minor" halign="left">
					<row header="yes">
						<cell>Healthcare Billed</cell>
						<cell>Plan A</cell>

						<cell><alert>$3400</alert></cell>

					<row>
						<cell>$1800</cell>
						<cell><alert>$3400</alert></cell>
						<cell>$3600</cell>
					</row>
					<row>
						<cell>$2000</cell>
						<cell><alert>$3400</alert></cell>
						<cell>$3800</cell>
					</row>
				</tabular>
			</solution>
			<solution>
				<title>Step 5 Again: Check for a reasonable answer and explain the conclusion</title>
				<p>
					We completed the table and noticed some patterns that help us verify that our values are correct. Each value goes up by $200 per row, until the deductible is met. We also marked the cheaper option in each row in bold and found the row where both plans are the same.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now we can see that Plan B starts out cheaper from $0 to $1600 in healthcare cost. They are equal at $1600 and Plan A saves you money after $1600. Having this full picture can help you choose what is best for you in the coming year. If you estimate you will have less than $1600 in billed healthcare, then it would be cheaper to select Plan B. If you think it is more likely you will have more than $1600 in the coming year, then Plan A would be cheaper. This decision has an element of risk or uncertainty and we will learn additional tools to work with that in the probability chapter.

	<title>Operation Sense</title>
	<p>
		In the problem we just did, notice what came intuitively to you. Did you have a sense for which plan would be cheaper? Did you intuitively know that we would use multiplication and addition? These operations are common in totalling values. They also make positive values larger. <term>Operation sense</term> is understanding what mathematical operations do and when to use them. There are many words and phrases that translate to certain operations and results in math. In this class you'll be practicing your operation sense to determine what steps to take.
	</p>
	<p>
		In this table we list some words and phrases that can indicate each operation, and what will happen as a result. Here we focus on operations with positive numbers, but some of our problems may use negative quantities as well. As an extension, see if you can explain why we get the results from each operation (especially multiplication and division) and what would happen with negative numbers.

		</tabular>
		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
			Determine which operation(s) you would use for each situation. There may be more than one correct answer.
		<ol marker="a">
			<li>
				<p>
					How many dollars of your paycheck you have left to spend.
				</p>

			<li>
				<p>

				</p>
			</li>

				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					How much you've spent on streaming services in the last two years.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					<ol marker="a">
			<li>
				<p>
					To calculate what you have left, you would subtract what you've already spent from your paycheck amount. You may need to use addition to total what you've already spent.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					To cut a recipe in half, we would either divide by 2 or multiply by one half.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					To calculate the number of tables, we would divide the number of guests by the number of seats at each table.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					To calculate the total spent on streaming services, we would likely multiply the monthly amount by the number of months. If there were multiple services we would add them together.

	<title>Number Sense and Estimation</title>
	<p>
		Another skill you have or are building is <term>number sense</term>. This has to do with understanding the size or magnitude of numbers, and patterns or relationships between numbers. A very useful tool when problem solving is using your number sense to <term>estimate</term> the result. Before you start, how large or small do you expect the answer to be? Would it be positive or negative? Do you expect a number less than one, or in the tens, thousands or millions? It is very important to come back at the end of a problem and use your number sense to make sure your answer seems reasonable.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Estimate a reasonable range of values for each situation.
		<ol marker="a">
			<li>
				<p>
					The weight of a stack of paving stones in the back of an SUV.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The number of people who can fit in a standard elevator.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The total revenue for one showing of a movie at a theater.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The number of scales on a fish.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
	</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>We haven't given many details here, so there is a wide range of possible answers. Sometimes it is more useful to think of answers that would not make sense.
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						The weight would be positive and we think it would have to be less than a couple thousand pounds.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The number of people would be 0 to maybe 20, depending on the size of the elevator.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The movie revenue would be between $0 and a few thousand. Of course this depends on the size of the theater.
					</p>
				</li>
					<li>
					<p>
						Without looking it up, we think it would be in the thousands or maybe ten-thousands. Of course it depends on the type and size of the fish, but we don't think it would be in the hundred-thousands or millions.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
		<p>
			Now that we have gone through an example using the problem solving process and talked about operations and number sense, we will continue with more mathematical tools to use in making decisions. We will focus the rest of this section on problem solving with percentages and absolute and relative change.

	<title>Solving Problems with Unit Conversions</title>

	<p>
		Many situations also require unit conversions. You can use your number and operation sense to know whether to multiply or divide or you can line up the units so they cancel out. Here are some unit conversions for reference.

				Step 1: We want to know how much the wood for the deck will cost. This will probably be in the thousands of dollars, possibly about $1000-2000, depending on the size of the deck and wood prices. In this context, estimates usually add 10% for parts of boards that don't get used so we will do that as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				Step 2: We need to know the size and shape of the deck, the type of boards and cost per board. You measure your deck and it's a 16 ft by 24 ft rectangle. Looking up prices online, you find 5/4-inch by 4-inch by 8-foot cedar deck boards for $11.99 each.
			</p>
			<p>
				Step 3: There are a few approaches we could take to this problem: 1) Go out to your deck and count the boards, 2) calculate the number of boards you will need using the area of the deck, or 3) calculate the area of the deck and find the approximate cost per square foot for deck boards.
			</p>
			<p>
				Step 4: Option 3 seems like the most efficient approach so we will try that. The area of the deck is <me>16\text{ feet} \cdot 24\text{ feet} = 384\text{ feet}^2</me>.
			</p>
			<p>
				To find the cost per square foot for decking boards, we could compute the area of the top of a single board, and then divide the cost by the area. Since the width of a board is 4 inches we also need to convert that into feet. So the area of a single board is
			</p>
			<p>
				<me>8\text{ feet}\cdot4\cancel{\mathrm{ inches}}\cdot\frac{1\text{ foot}}{12\cancel{\mathrm{ inches}}}=2.667\text{ ft}^2</me>
  				The cost per square foot of one board is
  				<me>\frac{\$11.99}{2.667\text{ ft}^2}\approx \$4.4957\text{ per square foot}</me>.
			</p>
			<p>
				This will allow us to estimate the material cost for the whole deck by multiplying
				<me>384\cancel{\mathrm{ feet}^2}\cdot\frac{\$4.4957}{\cancel{\mathrm{ feet}^2}}\approx\$1726.35</me>.
  			</p>
  			<p>
				Then we will add 10% to the cost. We can calculate the 10% and then add, or multiply by 1.10.
				<me>\$1726.35(1.10)\approx \$1898.99</me>.
				Step 5: This answer is reasonable and fits with our original estimate. You should save up or set aside about $1900 for this project. This is just the cost of the wood and doesn't include nails, screws or any foundation materials.
			</p>
			<p>
				For confirmation with a second method, we could use option 2. We divide

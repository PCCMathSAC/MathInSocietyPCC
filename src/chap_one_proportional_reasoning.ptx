<subsection>
<title>Ratios, Rates and Unit Rates</title>
	<p>
		When comparing two <em>like</em> quantities with division, we use a <term>ratio</term>. An example of this is a teacher to student ratio of 1 to 28. There are no units on the 1 or 28 because they are both people. When comparing two <em>unlike</em> quantities, we use a <term>rate</term>. If you traveled 15 miles to class and it took half an hour, that's a rate of 15 miles per half hour. We usually refer to speed in miles per hour or mph, so we can also transform that rate into 30 miles per hour and that is called a <term>unit rate</term>.
	</p>
	<assemblage>
		<title>Ratios and Rates</title>
			<p>
				A <term>ratio</term> is a comparison between two <em>like</em> quantities using division. We use the word <q>to</q> or a colon without units.
			</p>
			<p>
				A <term>rate</term> is a comparison of two <em>unlike</em> quantities using division. We use the word <q>per</q> or a division bar in the units.
			</p>
			<p>
				A <term>unit rate</term> is a rate where the denominator is one unit.
			</p>
	</assemblage>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Identify each quantity as a ratio, rate, or unit rate:
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						2:5
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						$3.98 per gallon
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{20 \text{ text messages}}{2\text{ hours}}</m>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						2:5 is a ratio. Notice this is not the same as the fraction 2<solidus/>5 because in a ratio of 2 parts to 5 parts there are 7 parts in total.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						$3.98 per gallon is a unit rate.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{18 \text{ text messages}}{2\text{ hours}}</m> is a rate, but not a unit rate.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</solution>

<subsection>
<title>Calculating Unit Rates to Compare Items</title>
	<p>
		You may have calculated unit rates while grocery shopping or seen them on store tags. This is an important way to compare different brands or sizes and save money. Let's look at an example.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			A 12-pack of sparkling water is on sale for $8.99. An 8-pack is selling for $6.49. If the cans are the same size, which is the better value?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				Using the units to guide us, we are interested in dollars per can. This means we will divide the price by the number of cans.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the 12-pack we have
				<me>\frac{\$8.99}{12\text{ cans}} = \$0.749\text{ per can}</me>
			</p>
				<p>
				For the 8-pack we have
				<me>\frac{\$6.49}{8\text{ cans}} = \$0.811\text{ per can}</me>
				In this case the 12-pack has the cheaper unit price. Often the larger size is a better value but that's not always the case. We could also compare using different units like the cost per ounce. Look for the unit prices next time you are in a grocery store or shopping online.

<subsection>
<title>Proportional Quantities</title>
	<p>
		In problem solving it is useful to know whether quantities are proportional or not. That is, do the quantities have the same size relative to each other? In a <term>proportional</term> relationship, there is a <term>constant rate or ratio</term>. One quantity is always a constant multiple of the other. This is also called a <term>scaling factor</term>.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, would you expect to drive through downtown Portland at the same rate as from Portland to Eugene? No, because you can't drive as fast through the city as on the freeway. Would you expect your Social Security tax deducted to be proportional to the amount of your paycheck? Yes, this should be a constant rate, at least up to a certain point of income.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Determine whether the following quantities are proportional.
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						Pairs of socks are on sale for 2 pair for $8 or 5 pair for $20.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The distance from Portland to San Francisco is about 536 miles and the airfare on Alaska Airlines is $207. The distance from Portland to New York City is about 2,439 miles and the airfare on Alaska Airlines is $554.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						Let's see if the unit price for one pair is the same for each price.
					</p>
					<sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
					<stack>
						<p>
							Two pair:
						</p>
					<p>
						<me>\frac{\$8}{2\text{ pair}}= \$4.00 \text{ per pair}</me>
					</p>
					</stack>
					<stack>
					<p>
						Five pair:
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>\frac{\$20}{5\text{ pair}}= \$4.00 \text{ per pair}</me>
					</p>
					</stack>
				</sidebyside>
				<p>
					These sock prices are proportional because they have the same price per pair.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						At a glance the airfares do not look proportional because it's a lot further to New York City and the price didn't go up as much as the distance. We will calculate the two rates to be sure:
					</p>
					<sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
					<stack>
						<p>
							Portland to San Francisco:
						</p>
					<p>
						<me>\frac{\$207}{536\text{ miles}}= \$0.386 \text{ per mile}</me>
					</p>
					</stack>
					<stack>
					<p>
						Portland to New York City:
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>\frac{\$554}{2{,}439\text{ miles}}= \$0.227 \text{ per mile}</me>
					</p>
					</stack>
				</sidebyside>
				<p>
					These flight costs are not proportional because they have different rates per mile.
				</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	<p>
		There are many situations where we know a rate and we want to scale another quantity to match that rate. These are called <term>proportion problems</term>. There are many ways to solve them and we will show you three ways. Some methods may work better in particular situations and according to your preference. We will solve proportion problems visually, using a rate and with a proportion equation.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Solving Proportion Problems Visually</title>
	<p>
		If you like visuals, you may want to use a visual scaling method to solve proportion problems whenever practical.
	</p>
	<example>
		<p>A map scale indicates that a half inch on the map corresponds to a distance of 3 miles. You measure the route of a hike and it is 2<nbsp/>1<solidus/>4 inches. How long is the hike?
		</p>
			<p>
				First we will draw a long rectangle and mark a small part with 1<solidus/>2 inch on the top corresponding with 3 miles along the bottom.
			</p>
			<image width="80%" source="images/language_logic_rules/1_proportion/visual_proportion_1.png">
					<shortdescription>A horizontal rectangle with a small segment marked one half inch on the top and 3 miles on the bottom.</shortdescription>
			</image>
			<p>
				Then we will mark additional segments until we get to 2<nbsp/>1<solidus/>4 inches along the top. We will write 3 miles along the bottom for every half inch and calculate any partial segments. A quarter is half of a segment, so that corresponds to 1.5 miles.
			</p>
			<image width="80%" source="images/language_logic_rules/1_proportion/visual_proportion_2.png">
					<shortdescription>A horizontal rectangle with four equal segments marked one half inch on the top and 3 miles along the bottom; The fifth segment is cut in half and labeled one quarter inch on the top and 1.5 miles on the bottom.</shortdescription>
			</image>
			<p>
				Now we can add up the distance along the bottom and we have 13.5 miles.
			</p>
			<p>
				This method works well with reasonably nice numbers. For this problem we were scaling up, but this method could also be used to scale down. In that case we would mark a large segment on the rectangle and then divide that into pieces.
			</p>
	</example>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Solving Proportion Problems with a Unit Rate</title>
	<p>
		Since we know there is a constant rate for proportional quantities, we can calculate that unit rate to solve a proportion problem. Here is an example using a unit rate.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			You want to estimate how much you will spend for gas on a vacation. Your car can drive about 300 miles on a tank of 12 gallons of gas. If you are planning a roadtrip that is 1,300 miles, how many gallons of gas will you need?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				We can divide either way to get our unit rate so we will choose miles per gallon. Dividing this way we get
				<me>\frac{300\text{ miles}}{12\text{ gallons}} = 25\text{ miles per gallon}</me>
				Now we can divide the trip length by the rate
				<me>1{,}300\text{ miles}\div25\text{ miles per gallon} = 52\text{ gallons}</me>
				You will need about 52 gallons for the trip.
			</p>
			<p>
				Use your number and operation sense to know when to multiply and divide. The number of gallons is going to be smaller than the number of miles so that's how we knew to divide in this case.
			</p>
			<p>
				If we had chosen, instead, to calculate the unit rate by dividing 12 gallons by 300 miles, we would have gotten
				<me>\frac{12\text{ gallons}}{300\text{ miles}} = 0.04\text{ gallons per mile}</me>
				Then we would multiply the trip length by the rate
				<me>1{,}300\text{ miles}\cdot0.04\text{ gallons per mile} = 52\text{ gallons}</me>
				Using either rate you will need about 52 gallons of gas for this trip. To estimate the cost you could multiply that by the price per gallon.
			</p>

	<title>Solving Proportion Problems with an Algebraic Equation</title>
	<p>
		You may be familiar with solving proportion equations using algebra. Because a proportional relationship means two things have a constant rate or ratio, we can set up an equation with two fractions equal to each other. We will use a variable for the unknown quantity and solve the equation. We will do the previous two examples again to show you this method.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are multiple ways to write the initial proportion equation. It will be equivalent if flipped from left to right or top to bottom. To make the equation easier to solve we will set up the equation to our advantage. We will put the variable in the upper left position and then we just need to align the units on each side of the equation.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>A map scale indicates that a half inch on the map corresponds to a distance of 3 miles. You measure the route of a hike and it is 2<nbsp/>1<solidus/>4 inches. How long is the hike?
		</p>
	</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				First, we write our equation and we will purposely organize it to put the variable in the numerator on the left side. Our unknown quantity, <m>x</m> miles, goes with the map distance of 2<nbsp/>1<solidus/>4 inches so we put that in the denominator on the left side. Then we match up our two known quantities to match the units on the left side.
				<md>
					<mrow>\frac{x\text{ miles}}{2\frac{1}{4}\text{ inches}}=\frac{3\text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{2}\text{ inch}}</mrow>
				</md>
				By setting it up this way, there is only one algebraic step. We need to undo the division on the left side by multiplying by 2<nbsp/>1<solidus/>4 inches on both sides. That will maintain equality and isolate the variable.
				<md>
					<mrow>\cancel{\highlight{2\frac{1}{4}\,\mathrm{ inches}}}\cdot\frac{x\text{ miles}}{\cancel{2\frac{1}{4}\,\mathrm{ inches}}}=\highlight{2\frac{1}{4}\text{ inches}}\cdot\frac{3\text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{2}\text{ inch}}</mrow>
				</md>
				After canceling the 2<nbsp/>1<solidus/>4 inches on the left side of the equation, the variable is isolated and we can calculate the result. Notice that the units of inches cancel out on the right side leaving us with miles. This is a great check that we have set the equation up correctly.
				<md>
					<mrow>x\amp=\frac{2\frac{1}{4}\,\cancel{\mathrm{ inches}}\cdot{3\text{ miles}}}{\frac{1}{2}\,\cancel{\mathrm{ inch}}}</mrow>
				</md>
				We can use the fraction feature on a calculator or the division bar with parentheses.
				<md>
					<mrow>x\amp=(2+1/4)\cdot3/(1/2)\text{ miles}</mrow>
					<mrow> \amp=13.5\text{ miles}</mrow>
				</md>
				The length of the hike is 13.5 miles.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	<p>
		We purposely set up the last equation with the variable on the upper left side to make solving easier. If you'd like a more general method that works for every proportion we'll show you that in the next example.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			You want to estimate how much you will spend for gas on a vacation. Your car can drive about 300 miles on a tank of 12 gallons of gas. If you are planning a roadtrip that is 1,300 miles, how many gallons of gas will you need?
		</p>
	</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				For this equation we will start with the given information and write the 300 miles per 12 gallons as a rate on the left side. For the right side, we know the trip is 1,300 miles so we line that up with the 300 miles in the numerator. We will use a variable, <m>x</m>, for the unknown quantity of gallons. We are looking for an answer in gallons so we will use that as a double check.
				<md>
					<mrow>\frac{300\text{ miles}}{12\text{ gallons}}=\frac{1{,}300\text{ miles}}{x\text{ gallons}}</mrow>
				</md>
				Now we can maintain this equal relationship and solve for <m>x</m> by doing the same operation on both sides of the equation. To undo division, we will multiply by one of the denominators first. To simplify the process we will remove the units for now and check them at the end.
				<md>
					<mrow>\highlight{x}\cdot\frac{300}{12}\amp=\highlight{x}\cdot\frac{1{,}300}{x}</mrow>
					<mrow>\highlight{x}\cdot\frac{300}{12}\amp=\cancel{\,x}\cdot\frac{1{,}300}{\cancel{\,x}}</mrow>
					<mrow>\frac{300x}{12}\amp=1{,}300</mrow>
				</md>
				After canceling the <m>x</m>'s on the right side and simplifying the left side, we will multiply by the other denominator. You could do these at the same time if you prefer.
				<md>
					<mrow>\highlight{12}\cdot\frac{300x}{12}\amp=\highlight{12}\cdot1{,}300</mrow>
					<mrow>\cancel{12}\cdot\frac{300x}{\cancel{12}}\amp=\highlight{12}\cdot1{,}300</mrow>
				</md>
				After canceling the <m>12</m>'s we see that we have <m>300x</m> on the left side but we want to know what <m>x</m> is. We will isolate the variable by using division to undo the multiplication operation.
				<md>
					<mrow>300x\amp=12\cdot1{,}300</mrow>
					<mrow></mrow>
					<mrow>\frac{300x}{\highlight{300}}\amp=\frac{12\cdot1{,}300}{\highlight{300}}</mrow>
					<mrow>\frac{\cancel{300}x}{\cancel{300}}\amp=\frac{12\cdot1{,}300}{300}</mrow>
					<mrow>x\amp=\frac{12\cdot1{,}300}{300}</mrow>
					<mrow></mrow>
					<mrow>\amp=52\text{ gallons}</mrow>
				</md>
				We can double check our units by putting them back in the last step to make sure they cancel properly.
				<!--Todo: Trying to fix the spacing when canceling:  1300\,\mathrm{miles} -->
				<md>
					<mrow>x\amp=\frac{12\text{ gallons}\cdot1{,}300\,\cancel{\mathrm{ miles}}}{300\,\cancel{\mathrm{ miles}}}</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp=52\text{ gallons}</mrow>
				</md>
				The miles cancel out and we are left with gallons so this is a good double check. You will need about 52 gallons of gas for the trip.

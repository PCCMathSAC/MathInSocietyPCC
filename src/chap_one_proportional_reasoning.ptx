	Another uesful tool in problem solving and decision making is comparison by division. This section may be review for you, and it may present math in a different light that is more concrete and applied than math you have had previously. Our goal is to examine math problems that are relevant to your life where you can apply your lived experience. Some of these problems involve a trade-off or more than one right answer. First, we will look at percentages, then rates, ratios and proportional quantities.

<subsection>
	<title>Percents</title>
		<p>
			If you went shopping and one shirt was $20 off and another shirt was $30 off it might be hard to tell which is the better value. What if they were 20% off and 30% off? Percentages can make quantities easier to compare.
		</p>
		<p>
			Percent, denoted by %, means “per 100,” or “parts per hundred.” In Spanish it's literally por ciento. When we write 30% off, that means you save 30 out of every 100 dollars. We can write this percentage as the fraction <m>\frac{30}{100}</m>. When we divide 30 by 100, we get <me>\frac{30}{100}=0.30.</me> We can also say you would save 30 cents out of every dollar. Many equivalent fractions can be written that equal 30%. Notice that 60 out of 200 and 15 out of 50 are also 30%, since <me>\frac{60}{200}=\frac{15}{50}=\frac{30}{100}=0.30.</me>
		</p>
		<example>
			<p>
				As an example, let's compare two shirts on sale and add some prices:
			</p>
			<sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
				<p>
					Shirt 1:
					<ul marker = "disc">
						<li>
							<p>
							Original Price: $80
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
							Sale: $20 off
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Shirt 2:
					<ul marker = "disc">
						<li>
							<p>
							Original Price: $100
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
							Sale: 30% off
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
				<p>
					What is the sale price and sale percentage for each shirt? Which is the better buy?
				</p>
				<sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
					<stack>
						<p>
							Shirt 1:
						</p>
					<p>
						For this shirt we have the dollar amount of the sale so we will subtract it from the original price.
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>\$80-20 = \$60</me>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now we will divide to find the percentage of the sale:
						<me>\frac{\$20}{\$80} = 0.25</me>.
					</p>
					<p>
						This shirt is 25% off and the sale price is $60.
					</p>
					</stack>
					<stack>
					<p>
						Shirt 2:
					</p>
					<p>
						For this shirt we know the percentage off so we need to find 30% of $100. We used a base of 100 so $30 off per $100 is $30.
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>30\% \text{ off of } \$100 \text{ is } \$30</m>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then we subtract the sale amount from the original price to get:
						<me>\$100-30 = \$70</me>.
					</p>
					<p>
						This shirt is 30% off and the sale price is $70.
					</p>
					</stack>
				</sidebyside>
			<p>
				Which shirt do you think is the better deal? You would save more with shirt 2, but shirt 1 is cheaper.

			<title>Converting Between Percentages and Decimals</title>
		<p>
			To convert a percentage to decimal form, we use the definition of "per 100." For example, <m>82\%</m> means <q>82 per 100</q> so we divide by 100 or move the decimal two places to the left and remove the % symbol.
			<me>82\% = \frac{82}{100}=0.82</me>
		</p>
		<p>
			To go the other way, if we have <m>0.10</m>, we can multiply it by 100% or move the decimal two places to the right and add the % symbol.
			<me>0.10 = 0.10(100\%)=10\%</me>
		</p>

	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Change each percentage into decimal form.
		<ol marker="a">
			<li>

			<li>
				<p>
					0.1%

		</p>
	</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>65\%=\frac{65}{100}=0.65</m>. Notice this is the same as moving the decimal to the left two places.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>200\%=\frac{200}{100}=2.0</m> or just <m>2</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>5.2\%=\frac{5.2}{100}=0.052</m>. If we use the method of moving the decimal two places to the left we use a zero to hold the place value and we get 0.052.
					</p>
				</li>
					<li>
					<p>
						<m>0.1\%=\frac{0.1}{100}=0.001</m>.

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>1.25(100\%)</m> or moving the decimal two places to the right gives 125%.

	<title>Calculating Percents</title>
	<p>
		When calculating percents, we divide the <term>part</term> by the <term>whole</term> amount. The whole amount is also called the <term>base</term> of the percentage. First we will look at how to calculate percents and then how to calculate a part.
	</p>

<assemblage>
			<title>Calculating Percents</title>
			<p>
				<me>\text{Percent} = \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}}</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				<me>\text{Part} = \text{percent} \cdot \text{whole}</me>
			</p>
			<!-- <p>
				Whole = percent <m>\cdot</m> part
			</p> -->
		</assemblage>
		<p>
			We can also think of these formulas as sentences. The word <term>is</term> means equals, <term>per</term> means divide, and <term>of</term> often means multiplication. So we can also say, <q>Percent is part per whole,</q> and, <q>Part is percent of whole.</q>
		</p>
		<example>
			<statement>
			<p>
				In a survey of 1,031 randomly chosen adults, 577 said they would feel better if they got more sleep (<url href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed.aspx"
					visual="news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed">source</url>). What percent is this?
			</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					First, we need to identify the part and the whole. The whole is the total number of adults surveyed. The part is the 577 adults who said they would feel better if they got more sleep.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using the formula <me>\text{Percent} = \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}}</me> we can calculate
						<me>\frac{577}{1013} \approx 0.570 \text{ or } 57\%</me>.
				</p>
				<p>
					About 57% of the adults surveyed said they would feel better if they got more sleep.
				</p>
			</solution>
	</example>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			First estimate which quantity is the larger percentage. Then calculate both percentages.
		<ol marker="a">
			<li>
				<p>
					A quiz score of 8 out of 10 or 11 out of 15.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					A cereal with 2 grams of sugar in a 28 gram serving size or 3 grams of sugar in a 32 gram serving size.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
	</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						We are estimating that 8 out of 10 seems larger compared to 11 out of 15 because missing 2 out of 10 seems like less than 4 out of 15.
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>\frac{8}{10} = 0.80 \text{ or } 80\%</me>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>\frac{11}{15} \approx 0.733 \text{ or } 73.3\%</me>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The score of 8 out of 10 is a higher percentage.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						We are estimating that 3 out of 32 is a higher percentage than 2 out of 28 because the added gram of sugar seems high compared with only a 4 gram increase in serving size.
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>\frac{2\text{ g}}{28\text{ g}} \approx 0.07 \text{ or about } 7\%</me>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>\frac{3\text{ g}}{32\text{ g}} \approx 0.09 \text{ or about } 9\%</me>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The cereal with 3 grams of sugar out of 32 grams has a higher percentage of sugar.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	<p>
		Another useful tool is finding the part when we know the percentage and the whole amount.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			For example, say you have a high yield online savings account that pays an annual interest rate of 4.5%. If you have $3000 in the account for your emergency fund, how much interest will you earn in a year? What would your total balance be with the interest?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			To perform calculations with percents, we change them into decimal form first. So we divide 4.5 by 100 or move the decimal two places to the left and we get 0.045.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then, using the formula <me>\text{part} = \text{percent} \cdot \text{whole}</me> we have
		</p>
		<p>
			<me>0.045(\$3000) = \$135</me>.
		</p>
		<p>
			You would earn $135 in interest. Interest is added to your account so we will add to find the total balance.
		</p>
		<p>
			<me>\$3000+135 = \$3,135</me>. Your total balance is $3,135 after one year.
		</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	<p>
		Note, most interest is compounded daily or monthly so we simplified the example above. We will come back to this and learn how to calculate compound interest in the financial math chapter.
	</p>
	
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Find each part described and the total or ending amount.
		<ol marker="a">
			<li>
				<p>
					A smartphone's battery life of 12 hours decreased by 20% after a year of use. Find the amount it decreased by and the current battery life.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The sales tax in Vancouver, Washington is currently 8.7%. How much tax would you pay on TV that costs $399 and what is the total price?
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
	</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						First we will find 20% of 12 hours by multiplying by the decimal form of the percentage: <me>12(0.20)=2.4\text{ hours}</me> Then we will subtract since the battery life went down. <me>12-2.4=9.6\text{ hours}</me>. The phone battery life went down by 2.4 hours to 9.6 hours.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						We will find 8.7% of $399 by multiplying the amount by the decimal form of the percentage: <me>\$399(0.087)=\$34.71</me> We rounded to the nearest cent. Then we will add since the tax is an additional cost. <me>\$399+34.71=\$433.71</me> The tax on the TV is $34.71, which gives a total price of $433.71.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
		</solution>
		<solution>
			<p>
				There is an optional shorter way to go about this type of problem if you are interested.
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					If we look at a 20% decrease as the battery retaining 80% of its life (100-20=80)%, we can calculate the new battery life directly

<subsection>
	<title>Absolute and Relative Change</title>

	<p>
		As we saw in the shirt sale prices, we can talk about a difference in absolute terms or relative terms. <term>Absolute change</term> is the actual amount of the change in dollars, people, etc. The change is positive if the value goes up and negative if it goes down. <term>Relative change</term> is the amount of change as a percentage of the starting amount. The relative change would have the same sign as the absolute change. Often we use words like increase or decrease to represent the sign.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, Portland Community College recently increased its tution from $128 to $133 per credit hour. The absolute change is the dollar increase of <me>\$133-\$128 = \$5\text{ per credit.}</me> The relative change is <me>\frac{\$5}{\$128}\approx 0.039</me> or a tuition increase of about 3.9%.
	</p>

	<assemblage>
		<title>Absolute and Relative Change</title>
			<p>
				<md>
				<mrow>\text{Absolute Change} \amp= \text{Ending Amount} - \text{Starting Amount}</mrow>
				<mrow></mrow>
				<mrow>\text{Relative Change} \amp= \frac{\text{Ending Amount} - \text{Starting Amount}}{\text{Starting Amount}} = \frac{\text{Absolute Change}}{\text{Starting Amount}}</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
	</assemblage>
	<p>
		The base of a percentage is very important and relative change is calculated as a percentage of the original amount because that was the amount before the change.
	</p>
<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Maria has been thinking about selling her car. The value went from $7400 to $6800 over the last year. What is the absolute and relative change in the car's value?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				First we will subtract to calculate the absolute change:
				<md>
					<mrow>\text{Absolute Change} \amp= \text{Ending Amount} - \text{Starting Amount}</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp=\$6800 - \$7400</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp=-\$600</mrow>
				</md>
			The absolute change is a decrease of $600 in the car's value.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now we can calculate the relative change:
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>\text{Relative Change} \amp= \frac{\text{Absolute Change}}{\text{Starting Amount}}</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp= \frac{-\$600}{\$7400}</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp\approx -0.081</mrow>
				</md>
				The relative change in the price of the car was a decrease of about 8.1% of it's value.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	<p>
		Notice in the last example we either used the negative sign or the word decrease to show the direction of the change. We could say the car's value changed by -8.1% or decreased by 8.1%. We wouldn't use both at the same time because that would be a double negative. Let's look at another example.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
			<p>
				After raises, Iryna's wage went from $22 to $25 per hour. Sundar's hourly wage went from $19 to $21.85. Calculate their absolute and relative raises. Who got a larger absolute raise? Who got a larger relative raise?
			</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				First we will calculate the absolute raises:
			</p>
			<sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
					<stack>
						<p>
							Iryna:
						</p>
					<p>
						<m>\$25 - \$22 = \$3</m>.
					</p>
					</stack>
					<stack>
					<p>
						Sundar:
					</p>
					<p>
						<m>\$21.85 - \$19 = \$2.85</m>.
					</p>
					</stack>
				</sidebyside>
			<p>
				Iryna got a larger absolute raise of $3 per hour compared with $2.85 for Sundar. Now we will calculate the relative raises.
			</p>
				<sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
					<stack>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{\$3}{\$22} \approx 0.136 \text{ or } 13.6\%</m>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Iryna's raise was about 13.6% of her pay.
					</p>
					</stack>
					<stack>
					<p>
						<m>\frac{\$2.85}{\$19} = 0.15 \text{ or } 15\%</m>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sundar's raise was 15% of his pay.
					</p>
					</stack>
				</sidebyside>
			<p>
				Sundar had a relative raise of 15% of his pay and Iryna's raise was about 13.6% of her pay. Iryna had the larger absolute raise but Sundar had the larger raise relative to their starting wages.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
</subsection>
<subsection>
	<title>Multiple Percent Changes</title>
	<p>
		We can also calculate values with multiple percent increases and decreases. We must be careful here because the base changes each time. For example, if a stock price drops by 60% in one week and increases by 75% the next week, this is not the same as an increase of 15%. The base for the drop is the original price and the base for the increase is the lower price. Let's look at this more closely in the next example.
	</p>

	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			A stock valued at $100 dropped in value by 60% one week, then increased in value the next week by 75%. Is the value higher or lower than where it started? What is the ending value and what is the combined relative change?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				After one week, the value dropped by 60%:
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow>\$100 - \$100(0.60) \amp= \$100 - \$60</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp= \$40</mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				In the next week, notice that base of the percent has changed to the new value of $40. Computing the 75% increase:
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow>\$40 + \$40(0.75) \amp= \$40 + \$30</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp= \$70</mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				In the end, the stock is $70, which is $30 lower, or 30% lower than it started.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is optional, but if you enjoyed the shorter method we showed before, you can also use it for multiple percent changes.
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow>\$100(1-0.60)(1+0.75) \amp= \$100(0.40)(1.75)</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp= \$70</mrow>
			</md>
		</solution>

	Percents are a specific type of comparison by division using a denominator of 100. Now we will expand our problem solving tools to more general ratios, rates and proportions.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
<title>Ratios, Rates and Unit Rates</title>
	<p>
		When comparing two like quantities with division, we use a <term>ratio</term>. An example of this is a teacher to student ratio of 1 to 28. There are no units on the 1 or 28 because they are both people. When comparing two unlike quantities, we use a <term>rate</term>. If you traveled 15 miles to class and it took half an hour, that's a rate of 15 miles per half hour. We usually refer to speed in miles per hour or mph, so we can also transform that rate into 30 miles per hour and that is a <term>unit rate</term>.
	</p>
	<assemblage>
		<title>Ratios and Rates</title>
			<p>
				A <term>ratio</term> is a comparison between two like quantities using division. We often use the word <q>to,</q> a colon or division bar without units.
			</p>
			<p>
				A <term>rate</term> is a comparison of two unlike quantities using division. We often use the word <q>per</q> or a division bar in the units.
			</p>
			<p>
				A <term>unit rate</term> is a rate where the denominator is one unit.
			</p>

<title>Proportional Quantities</title>
	<p>
		In problem solving it is useful to know whether quantities are proportional or not. That is, do the two quantities have the same size relative to each other? In a <term>proportional</term> relationship, there is a constant rate or ratio. One quantity is always a constant multiple of the other.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, would you expect to drive through downtown Portland at the same rate as from Portland to Eugene? No, because one trip is going through the city and the other is mostly on the freeway. Would you expect your Social Security tax deducted to be proportional to the amount of your paycheck? Yes, this should be a constant rate, at least up to a certain point of income.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			Determine whether the following quantities are proportional to each other.
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						The distance from Portland to San Francisco is about 536 miles and the airfare on Alaska Airlines is $207. The distance from Portland to New York City is about 2,439 miles and the airfare on Alaska Airlines is $554.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Pairs of socks are on sale for 2 pair for $8 each or 5 pair for $20.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			<ol marker="a">
				<li>
					<p>
						At a glance these do not look proportional because it's a lot further to New York City and the airfare didn't go up as much as the distance. We will calculate the two rates to be sure:
					</p>
					<sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
					<stack>
						<p>
							Portland to San Francisco:
						</p>
					<p>
						<me>\frac{\$207}{536\text{ miles}}= \$0.386 \text{ per mile}</me>.
					</p>
					</stack>
					<stack>
					<p>
						Portland to New York City:
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>\frac{\$554}{2439\text{ miles}}= \$0.227 \text{ per mile}</me>.
					</p>
					</stack>
				</sidebyside>
				<p>
					These flight costs are not proportional because they have different rates per mile.
				</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The sock prices look proportional so let's verify that:
					</p>
					<sidebyside widths="40% 40%">
					<stack>
						<p>
							Two pair:
						</p>
					<p>
						<me>\frac{\$8}{2\text{ pair}}= \$4.00 \text{ per pair}</me>.
					</p>
					</stack>
					<stack>
					<p>
						Five pair:
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>\frac{\$20}{5\text{ pair}}= \$4.00 \text{ per pair}</me>.
					</p>
					</stack>
				</sidebyside>
				<p>
					These sock prices are proportional because they have the same price per pair.
				</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	<p>
		There are many situations where we know a rate and we want to scale another quantity to match that rate. These are called proportion problems. There are many ways to solve them and we will show you three ways. Some methods may work better in particular situations and according to your preference. We will solve proportion problems visually, using a rate and with a proportion equation.
	</p>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Solving Proportion Problems Visually</title>
	<p>
		If you like visuals, you may want to use a visual scaling method to solve proportion problems whenever practical.
	</p>
	<example>
		<p>A map scale indicates that a half inch on the map corresponds to a distance of 3 miles. You measure the route of a hike and it is 2<nbsp/>1<solidus/>4 inches. How long is the hike?
		</p>
			<p>
				First we will draw a long rectangle and mark a small part with 1<solidus/>2 inch on the top corresponding with 3 miles along the bottom.
			</p>
			<image width="80%" source="images/language_logic_rules/1_proportion/visual_proportion_1.png">
					<shortdescription>A horizontal rectangle with a small segment marked one half inch on the top and 3 miles on the bottom.</shortdescription>
			</image>
			<p>
				Then we will mark additional segments until we get to 2<nbsp/>1<solidus/>4 inches along the top. We will write 3 miles along the bottom for every half inch and calculate any partial segments. A quarter is half of a segment, so that corresponds to 1.5 miles.
			</p>
			<image width="80%" source="images/language_logic_rules/1_proportion/visual_proportion_2.png">
					<shortdescription>A horizontal rectangle with four equal segments marked one half inch on the top and 3 miles along the bottom; The fifth segment is cut in half and labeled one quarter inch on the top and 1.5 miles on the bottom.</shortdescription>
			</image>
			<p>
				Now we can add up the distance along the bottom and we have 13.5 miles.
			</p>
			<p>
				This method works well with reasonably nice numbers. For this problem we were scaling up, but this method could also be used to scale down. In that case we would mark a large segment on the rectangle and then divide that into pieces.
			</p>
	</example>
</subsection>

<subsection>
	<title>Solving Proportions Problems with a Unit Rate</title>
	<p>
		Since we know there is a constant rate, we can also calculate the unit rate to solve a proportion problem. Here is another example soved with a unit rate.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			A car can drive 300 miles on a tank of 12 gallons of gas. If you are planning a roadtrip that is 1,300 miles, how many gallons of gas will you need?
		</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				We can divide either way to get our unit rate so we will choose miles per gallon. Dividing this way we get
				<me>\frac{300\text{ miles}}{12\text{ gallons}} = 25\text{ miles per gallon}</me>.
				Now we can divide the trip length by the rate
				<me>1,300\text{ miles}\div25\text{ miles per gallon} = 52\text{ gallons}</me>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Use your number and operation sense to know when to multiply and divide. The number of gallons is smaller than the number of miles so that's how we knew to divide in this case.
			</p>
			<p>
				If we had chosen, instead, to calculate the unit rate by dividing 12 gallons by 300 miles instead, we would have gotten
				<me>\frac{12\text{ gallons}}{300\text{ miles}} = 0.04\text{ gallons per mile}</me>.
				Then we would multiply the trip length by the rate
				<me>1,300\text{ miles}\cdot0.04\text{ gallons per mile} = 52\text{ gallons}</me>.
				You will need 52 gallons of gas for this trip.
			</p>
		</solution>

	<title>Solving Proportion Problems with an Algebraic Equation</title>
	<p>
		You may be familiare with solving proportion equations using algebra. Because a proportional relationship means two things have a constant rate or ratio, we can set up an equation with two fractions equal to each other, use a variable for the unknown quantity, and solve it. We will do the previous two examples again to show you this method.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are multiple ways to write the initial proportion equation. It will be equivalent if flipped from left to right or top to bottom. So we can set up the equation to our advantage. We just need to align the units on each side of the equation.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>A map scale indicates that a half inch on the map corresponds to a distance of 3 miles. You measure the route of a hike and it is 2<nbsp/>1<solidus/>4 inches. How long is the hike?
		</p>
	</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				First, we write our equation and we will purposely organize it to put the variable, <m>x</m>, in the numerator on the left side. Our unknown quantity goes with the map distance of 2<nbsp/>1<solidus/>4 inches so we put that in the denominator on the left side. Then we match up our two known quantities to match the units on the left side.
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{x\text{ miles}}{2\frac{1}{4}\text{ inches}}=\frac{3\text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{2}\text{ inch}}</mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				By setting it up this way, there is only one algebraic step. We need to undo the division on the left side by multiplying by 2<nbsp/>1<solidus/>4 inches on both sides. That will maintain equality and isolate the variable.
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow>\cancel{\highlight{2\frac{1}{4}\mathrm{ inches}}}\cdot\frac{x\text{ miles}}{\cancel{2\frac{1}{4}\mathrm{ inches}}}=\highlight{2\frac{1}{4}\text{ inches}}\cdot\frac{3\text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{2}\text{ inch}}</mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				After canceling the 2<nbsp/>1<solidus/>4 inches, the variable is isolated and we can calculate the result.
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow>x\amp=\frac{2\frac{1}{4}\cancel{\mathrm{ inches}}\cdot{3\text{ miles}}}{\frac{1}{2}\cancel{\mathrm{ inch}}}</mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				We can use the fraction feature on a calculator or the division bar with parentheses.
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow>x\amp=(2+1/4)\cdot3/(1/2)\text{ miles}</mrow>
				<mrow>x\amp=13.5\text{ miles}</mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				The length of the hike is 13.5 miles.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	<p>
		We purposely set up the last equation with the variable on the upper left side to make solving easier. If you'd like a more general method that works for every proportion we'll show you that in the next example.
	</p>
	<example>
		<statement>
		<p>
			A car can drive 300 miles on a tank of 12 gallons of gas. If you are planning a roadtrip that is 1,300 miles, how many gallons of gas will you need?
		</p>
	</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				For this equation we will start with the given information and write that as a rate on one side. For the corresponding rate, we know the trip is 1,300 miles so we line that up with the 300 miles in the numerator. We will use a variable, <m>x</m>, for the unknown quantity. We are looking for an answer in gallons so we will use that as a double check.
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{300\text{ miles}}{12\text{ gallons}}=\frac{1300\text{ miles}}{x\text{ gallons}}</mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				Now we can maintain this equal relationship and solve for <m>x</m> by doing the same operation on both sides of the equation. To undo division, we will multiply by one of the denominators first. To simplify the process we will remove the units for now and check them at the end.
			</p>
			
			<md>
				<mrow>\highlight{x}\cdot\frac{300}{12}\amp=\highlight{x}\cdot\frac{1300}{x}</mrow>
				<mrow>\highlight{x}\cdot\frac{300}{12}\amp=\cancel{x}\cdot\frac{1300}{\cancel{x}}</mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{300x}{12}\amp=1300</mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				After canceling the <m>x</m>'s on the right side and simplifying the left side, we will multiply by the other denominator. You could do these at the same time if you prefer.
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow>\highlight{12}\cdot\frac{300x}{12}\amp=\highlight{12}\cdot1300</mrow>
				<mrow>\cancel{12}\cdot\frac{300x}{\cancel{12}}\amp=\highlight{12}\cdot1300</mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				After canceling the <m>12</m>'s we see that we have <m>300x</m> on the left side but we want to know what <m>x</m> is. We will isolate the variable by using division to undo the multiplication operation.
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow>300x\amp=12\cdot1300</mrow>
				<mrow></mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{300x}{\highlight{300}}\amp=\frac{12\cdot1300}{\highlight{300}}</mrow>
				<mrow>\frac{\cancel{300}x}{\cancel{300}}\amp=\frac{12\cdot1300}{300}</mrow>
				<mrow>x\amp=\frac{12\cdot1300}{300}</mrow>
				<mrow></mrow>
				<mrow>x\amp=52\text{ gallons}</mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				We can double check our units by putting them back in the last step to make sure they cancel properly.
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow>x\amp=\frac{12\text{ gallons}\cdot1300\cancel{\mathrm{  miles}}}{300\cancel{\mathrm{  miles}}}</mrow>
				<mrow>x\amp=52\text{ gallons}</mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				The miles cancel out and we are left with gallons so this is a good double check.
			</p>

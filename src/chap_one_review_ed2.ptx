			You are planning to have your bathroom floor tiled with 8 inch by 8 inch tiles, that cost $17.54 per box of 12 tiles. The tiled area is approximately 8 feet by 10 feet and the tiler charges a base fee of $100 and $12 per square foot. The grout and other materials are estimated at $10 per square foot. About how much will the project cost? Add 10% to the number of tiles for partial tiles needed.

	<solution>
		<p>
			<!-- Solution: The room is 8x10=80 square feet. Each tile is 8/12x8/12 =0.4444 square feet. 80/0.4444 is 180 tiles plus 10% is 198 tiles. 198/12 is 16.5 boxes of tile so you would need to get 17 boxes. 17x17.54 is $298.18. Then add $100 plus 80(12+10). 100+1760+298.18=$2158.18. -->

	<solution>
		<p>
			<!-- The volume of the pool minus 6 inches is pix7.5^2x3.5 = 618.5 cubic feet, which is 6.185 ccf. The cost of the water is 6.185x$7.559 = $46.75. 6.185x748=4626.38 gallons. This would be 0.9253 tablets. -->
			The water cost is about $46.75 and you would need about 0.93 tablets. You would need to do some research to determine whether it's appropriate to use a full tablet or not.

Thanks also to Kaela Parks and Michael Cantino of Disability Services for their expertise on accessibility.    Antiracist and Culturally Responsive Elements  Our goal is for our students to see themselves in this book. We have added stories of mathematicians and economists with identities that have traditionally been underrepresented in textbooks. We use local places and culturally diverse names in the examples and exercises. We have examples with they\/them\/their pronouns and same-sex couples.  In the democracy chapter we have included the Native American genocide and slavery which are often left out of math texts. We have also emphasized the names of civil rights leaders and African Americans killed by the police in our examples. We recognize there is more to do in this area and welcome contributions and feedback. Please email Cara Lee at cara.lee@pcc.edu or use the Google Form link below.    Philosophy  Our goal is for the content of this book to be relevant and accessible to our readers. We emphasize technology, conceptual understanding and communication over rote calculation.

  "body": " The Language and Rules of Logic   The Language and Rules of Logic   Students will be able to:     Identify propositions    Compose and interpret the negation of a statement    Use logical connectors (and\/or) and conditional statements (if, then)    Use truth tables to find truth values of basic and complex statements       Alternative Video Lesson      Logic   Logic is the study of reasoning. Our goal in this chapter is to examine arguments to determine their validity and soundness. In this section we will look at propositions and logical connectors that are the building blocks of arguments. We will also use truth tables to help us examine complex statements.    Propositions  A proposition is a complete sentence that is either true or false. Opinions can be propositions, but questions or phrases cannot.    Which of the following are propositions?   I am reading a math book.    Math is fun!    Do you like turtles?    My cat       The first and second items are propositions. The third one is a question and the fourth is a phrase, so they are not. We are not concerned right now about whether a statement is true or false. We will come back to that later when we examine full arguments.    Arguments are made of one or more propositions (called premises ), along with a conclusion . Propositions may be negated , or combined with connectors like “and”, and “or”. Let's take a closer look at how these negations and logical connectors are used to create more complex statements.    Negation (not)  One way to change a proposition is to use its negation , or opposite meaning. We often use the word not to negate a statement.    Write the negation of the following propositions.   I am reading a math book.    Math is fun!    The sky is not green.    Cars have wheels          Negation: I am not reading a math book.    Negation: Math is not fun!    Negation: The sky is green (or not not green)    Negation: Cars do not have wheels.         Multiple Negations  It is possible to use more than one negation in a statement. If you've ever said something like, I can't not go, you are really saying you must go. It's a lot like multiplying two negative numbers which gives a positive result.  In the media and in ballot measures we often see multiple negations and it can be confusing to figure out what a statement means.    Read the statement to determine the outcome of a yes vote.   Vote for this measure to repeal the ban on plastic bags.     If you said that a yes vote would enable plastic bag usage, you are correct. The ban stopped plastic bag usage, so to repeal the ban would allow it again. This measure has a double negation and is also not very good for the environment.      Read the statement to determine the outcome on mandatory minimum sentencing.   The bill that overturned the ban on mandatory minimum sentencing was vetoed.     In this case mandatory minimum sentencing would not be allowed. The ban would stop it, and the bill to overturn it was vetoed. This is an example of a triple negation.      Logical Connectors (and, or)  When we use the word and between two propositions, it connects them to create a new statement that is also a proposition. For example, if you said To finish this project, I need a screwdriver and a wrench, then you are expressing the need for both tools. For an and statement to be true, the connected propositions must both be true. If even one proposition is false (for instance, you didn't need a wrench) then the entire connected statement is false.  The word or between two propositions similarly connects the propositions to create a new statement. In this case, if you said To finish this project, I need a screwdriver or a wrench, then you are expressing the need for one of the tools (but probably not both). For an or statement to be true, at least one of the propositions must be true (or both could be true).    Exclusive vs. Inclusive or  In English we often mean for or to be exclusive : one or the other, but not both. In math, however, or is usually inclusive : one or the other, or both. The thing we are including, or excluding is the both option.    Determine whether each or statement is inclusive or exclusive.   Would you like a chicken or vegan meal?    We want to hire someone who speaks Spanish or Chinese    Are you going to wear sandals or tennis shoes?    Are you going to visit Thailand or Vietnam on your trip?       The first or statement is a choice of one or the other, but not both, so it is exclusive. The second statement is inclusive because they could find a candidate who speaks both languages. The third statement is exclusive because you can't wear both at the same time. The fourth statement is inclusive because you could visit both countries on your trip.      Conditional Statements (if, then)  A conditional statement connects two propositions with if, then . An example of a conditional statement would be If it is raining, then we'll go to the mall.   The statement If it is raining, may be true or false for any given day. If the condition is true, then we will follow the course of action and go to the mall. If the condition is false, though, we haven't said anything about what we will or won't do.    Basic Truth Tables  In logic we can use a truth table to analyze a complex statement by summarizing all the possibilities and their truth values (true or false). To do this, we break the statement down to its smallest elements, the propositions. Then we can see the outcome of the complex statement for all possible combinations of true and false for the propositions.  For example, let's work with two propositions:    R : You paid your rent this month.     E : You paid your electric bill this month.     We will use these two propositions to demonstrate the truth tables for not, and, and or.      To set up a truth table, we list all the possible truth value combinations in a systematic way. The standard way of doing this is to make the first column half true, then half false, then cut the pattern in half with each succeeding column. For two propositions, the first two columns are shown to the right.   Truth Table Setup for Two Propositions    R  E  R and E    T  T     T  F     F  T     F  F        The four possible combinations are   Row 1: You have paid your rent and electric bill    Row 2: You have paid your rent but not your electric bill    Row 3: You have not paid your rent but you have paid your electric bill    Row 4: You haven't paid either your rent or electric bill (yet).     Once we fill in the starting columns, we add additional columns for the more complex statements. We can add as many columns as needed. Below are the basic truth tables for not, and, and or.    Basic Truth Tables     Not : In the not R column, the truth value is the opposite of the value for R . For example, if R is true (you paid your rent) then not R (you did not pay your rent) is false.    R  not R    T  F    F  T      And : In the R and E column, you must have paid both your rent and electric bill. Otherwise R and E is false.    R  E  R and E    T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  F    F  F  F        Or : In the R or E column, you must have paid either your rent or electric bill, or both (inclusive or). Otherwise R or E is false.    R  E  R or E    T  T  T    T  F  T    F  T  T    F  F  F        Conditional Truth Tables  We talked about conditional statements ( if, then statements), earlier. In logical arguments the first part (the if part) is usually a hypothesis and the second part (the then part) is a conclusion .  To understand the truth table values for a conditional statement it is helpful to look at an example. Let's say a friend tells you, If you post that photo to Facebook, you'll lose your job. Under what conditions can you say that your friend was wrong?  There are four possible outcomes:   You post the photo and lose your job    You post the photo and don't lose your job    You don't post the photo and lose your job    You don't post the photo and don't lose your job     The only case where you can say your friend was wrong is the second case, in which you post the photo but still keep your job.  Your friend didn't say anything about what would happen if you didn't post the photo, so you can't say the last two statements are wrong. Even if you didn't post the photo and lost your job anyway, your friend never said that you were guaranteed to keep your job if you didn't post it.  The four cases above correspond to the four rows of the truth table. For this truth table we will use P for posting the photo, and L for losing your job.    Truth table for a conditional statement    P  L  If P , then L    T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  T    F  F  T     If the hypothesis (the if part) is false, we cannot say that the statement is a lie, so the result of the third and fourth rows is true. Notice that we are using a double negation in this explanation.  We are using the words and, or, not and if then in this book, but if you look up other resources on truth tables you are likely to see these symbols.   Symbols used in other resources   is written    is written    is written ~    is written      Truth Tables for Complex Statements  Truth tables really become useful when we analyze more complex statements. In this case we will have several columns. It helps to work from the inside out and create a column in the table for each intermediate statement.    Create a truth table for the statement A or not B      When we create the truth table, we start with columns for the propositions, A and B . Then we add a column for not B because that is part of the final statement. Our last column is the final statement A or not B .    A  B  not B  A or not B    T  T      T  F      F  T      F  F        To complete the third column, not B , we take the opposite of the B column. Then to complete the fourth column, we only look at the A and the not B columns and compare them using or .    A  B  not B  A or not B    T  T  F  T    T  F  T  T    F  T  F  F    F  F  T  T         Truth Tables with Three Propositions  To create a truth table with three propositions we need eight rows for all the possible combinations. We will first determine the columns we need to get to our final statement. Then we will fill in the first three columns using the same methodology as before. Start with half true, half false, then cut the pattern in half each time.    Create a truth table for the statement A and not (B or C)     First let's figure out the columns we will need. We have A, B, C, then we need the statement in the parentheses, (B or C) . Then we need the negation of that column, not (B or C) . Then we conclude with our final statement, A and not (B or C) .  Here is the initial table:      A  B  C  B or C  not (B or C)  A and not (B or C)    T  T  T       T  T  F       T  F  T       T  F  F       F  T  T       F  T  F       F  F  T       F  F  F        Now we complete the columns one at a time. We use the B column and C column to complete B or C, . Then not (B or C) is the opposite of that column. For the final column we only need to look at the first and fifth columns, shaded in blue, with and . Here is the completed table.      A  B  C  B or C  not (B or C)  A and not (B or C)    T  T  T  T  F  F    T  T  F  T  F  F    T  F  T  T  F  F    T  F  F  F  T  T    F  T  T  T  F  F    F  T  F  T  F  F    F  F  T  T  F  F    F  F  F  F  T  F     For this statement A must be true and neither B or C can be true, so it is only true in the fourth row. For an example of this statement, let's define these propositions in the context of professional baseball:  Let A = Anaheim wins, B = Baltimore wins, C = Cleveland wins.  Suppose that Anaheim will make the playoffs if: (1) Anaheim wins, and (2) neither Boston nor Cleveland wins. TFF is the only scenario in which Anaheim will make the playoffs.      Construct a truth table for the statement if m and not p, then r .    First, it may help to add parentheses to help you clarify the order. Our statement could also be written, if (m and not p), then r . To build this table, we will build the statement in parentheses and then repeat the r column after it. It's easier to read the conditional statement from left to right. Here are the columns for the table:      m  p  r  not p  m and not p  r  If (m and not p), then r    T  T  T        T  T  F        T  F  T        T  F  F        F  T  T        F  T  F        F  F  T        F  F  F         For the fourth column, we take the opposite of p . Then we use the first and fourth columns to complete m and not p . With the r column repeated we can use columns five and six to complete our conditional statement. Here is the completed table:      m  p  r  not p  m and not p  r  If (m and not p), then r    T  T  T  F  F  T  T    T  T  F  F  F  F  T    T  F  T  T  T  T  T    T  F  F  T  T  F  F    F  T  T  F  F  T  T    F  T  F  F  F  F  T    F  F  T  T  F  T  T    F  F  F  T  F  F  T     When m is true, p is false, and r is false—the fourth row of the table—then the hypothesis m and not p will be true, but the conclusion is false, resulting in an invalid conditional statement; every other case gives a true result.  If you want a real-life situation that could be modeled by if m and not p , then r , consider this:  Let m = we order meatballs, p = we order pasta, and r = Ruba is happy.  The statement if m and not p , then r is, if we order meatballs and don't order pasta, then Ruba is happy . If m is true (we order meatballs), p is false (we don't order pasta), and r is false (Ruba is not happy), then the statement is false, because we satisfied the premise, but Ruba did not satisfy the conclusion.    In this section we have discussed propositions, logical connectors and truth tables. In the next section, we will look at set relationships before we analyze arguments.

  "body": " Sets and Venn Diagrams   Sets and Venn Diagrams   Students will be able to:     Use set notation and understand the null set    Determine the universal set for a given context    Use Venn diagrams and set notation to illustrate the intersection, union and complements of sets    Illustrate disjoint sets, subsets and overlapping sets with diagrams    Use Venn diagrams and problem-solving strategies to solve logic problems       Alternative Video Lesson      Sets  It is natural for us to classify items into groups, or sets , and consider how they interact with each other. In this section, we will use sets and Venn diagrams to visualize relationships between groups and represent survey data.  A set is a collection of items or things. Each item in a set is called a member or an element .      The numbers 2 and 42 are elements of the set of all even numbers.    MTH 105 is a member of the set of all courses you are taking.      A set consisting entirely of elements of another set is called a subset . For instance, the set of numbers 2, 6, and 10 is a subset of the set of all even numbers.  Some sets, like the set of even numbers, can be defined by simply describing their contents. We can also define a set by listing its elements using set notation .    Set Notation   Set notation is used to define the contents of a set. Sets are usually named using a capital letter, and its elements are listed once inside a set of curly brackets.  For example, to write the set of primary colors using set notation, we could name the set C for colors, and list the names of the primary colors in brackets: C = {red, yellow, blue} . In this case, the set C is a subset of all colors. If we wanted to write the list of our favorite foods using set notation, we could write F = {cheese, raspberries, wine} . And yes, wine is definitely an element of some food group!    Julia, Keenan, Jae and Colin took a test. They got the following scores: 70, 95, 85 and 70. Let P be the set of test takers and S be the set of test scores. List the elements of each set using set notation.    In this example, the set of people taking the test is P = {Julia, Keenan, Jae, Colin}, and the set of test scores is S = {70, 85, 95}. Notice in this example that even though two people scored a 70 on the test, the score of 70 is only listed once.    It is important to note that when we write the elements of a set in set notation, there is no order implied. For example, the set {1, 2, 3} is equivalent to the set {3, 1, 2}. It is conventional, however, to list the elements in order if there is one.    Universal Set  The universal set is the set containing every possible element of the described context. Every set is therefore a subset of the universal set. The universal set is often illustrated by a rectangle labeled with a capital letter U . Subsets of the universal set are usually illustrated with circles for simplicity, but other shapes can be used.       If you are searching for books for a research project, the universal set might be all the books in the library, and the books in the library that are relevant to your research project would be a subset of the universal set.   A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U, labeled all books in the library; there is a circle inside the rectangle, labeled books relevant to your research project.       If you are wanting to create a group of your Facebook friends that are coworkers, the universal set would be all your Facebook friends and the group of coworkers would be a subset of the universal set.   A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U, labeled all your facebook friends; there is a circle inside the rectangle, labeled coworkers.       If you are working with sets of numbers, the universal set might be all whole numbers, and all prime numbers would be a subset of the universal set.   A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U, labeled all whole numbers; there is a circle inside the rectangle, labeled all whole numbers.          The Null Set  It is possible to have a set with nothing in it. This set called the null set or empty set . It's like going to the grocery store to buy your favorite foods and realizing you left your wallet at home. You walk away with an empty bag. The set of items that you bought at the grocery store would written in set notation as G = { } , or G = Ø .    Intersection, Union, and Complement (And, Or, Not)  Suppose you and your roommate decide to have a house party, and you each invite your circle, or set, of friends. When you combine your two sets of friends, you discover that you have some friends in common.  The set of friends that you have in common is called the intersection . The intersection of two sets contains only the elements that are in both sets. To be in the intersection of set A and B , an element needs to be in both set A  and set B .  The set of all friends that you and your roommate have invited is called the union . The union of two sets contains all the elements contained in either set (or both). To be in the union of set A and set B , an element must to be contained in just set A , just set B , or in the intersection of sets A and B . Notice that in this case that the or is inclusive.  What about the people who were not invited to the party and showed up anyway? They are not elements of your set of invited friends. Nor are they an element of your roommate's set of invited friends. These uninvited party crashers are the complement to your set of invited friends. The complement of a set A contains everything that is not in the set A . To be in the complement of set A , an element cannot be in set A , but it will be an element of the universal set.    Consider the sets: A = {red, green, blue}, B = {red, yellow, orange}, and C = {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple}   Determine the set A intersect B , and write it in set notation.    Determine the set A union B , and write it in set notation.    Determine the intersection of A complement and C and write it in set notation.          The intersection contains the elements in both sets: A intersect B = {red}    The union contains all the elements in either set: A union B = {red, green, blue, yellow, orange}. Notice we only list red once.    Here we are looking for all the elements that are not in set A and are in set C : A complement intersect C = {orange, yellow, purple}         Venn Diagrams   Venn diagrams are used to illustrate the relationships between two or more sets. To create a Venn diagram, start by drawing a rectangle to represent the universal set. Next draw and label overlapping circles to represent each of your sets. Most often there will be two or three sets illustrated in a Venn diagram. Finally, if you are given elements, fill in each region with its corresponding elements. Venn diagrams are also a great way to illustrate intersections, unions and complements of sets as shown below.      The intersection is where the shading of the two sets overlaps in the center. It contains the elements of A and B.   A Venn diagram of two overlapping sets, labeled set A and set B, with 3 regions; the crescent shape in yellow indicates the region for members who are only in set A; the crescent shape shaded blue indicates the members who are only in set B; the overlapping region in the middle is shaded green to indicate member in both sets; the green area is called the intersection     The union includes all elements of A or B or both. It contains all three of the shaded regions.   The same Venn diagram used to illustrate the union is all 3 regions     The complement of set A includes all the elements not in A. It is the shaded region outside the set of A, but within the universal set.   A Venn diagram with only one set A; The region outside the circle for A but inside the rectangle is shaded blue to represent the complement of the set or elements not in set A.      Here is an example of how to draw a Venn Diagram.    Let J be the set of books Julio read this summer and let R be the set of books Rose read this summer. Draw a Venn diagram to show the sets of books they read if Julio read Game of Thrones, Animal Farm and 1984, and Rose read The Hobbit, 1984, The Tipping Point, and Greek Love.  To create a Venn diagram showing the relationship between the set of books Julio read and the set of books Rose read, first draw a rectangle to illustrate the universal set of all books.  Next draw two overlapping circles, one for the set of books Julio read and one for the set of books Rose read. Since both Rose and Julio read 1984, we place it in the overlapping region (the intersection).  All the books that Rose read will lie in her circle, in one of the two regions that make up her set. Likewise for the books Julio read. Since we have already filled in the overlapping region, we put the books that only Rose read in her circle's cresent moon section, and we put the books that only Julio read in his circle's cresent moon section. The resulting diagram is shown below.    A Venn diagram with 2 overlapping sets, one for Rose and one for Julio; The books that only rose read are in her crescent: The Hobbit, The tipping Point, and Greek Love; The books that only Julio read are in his crescent: Game of Thrones and Animal Farm; the books they both read are in the center region: 1984.       In the last section we discussed the difference between inclusive or and exclusive or. In common language, or is usually exclusive, meaning the set A or B includes just A or just B but not both. In logic, however, or is inclusive, so the set A or B includes just A , just B , or both. The difference between the inclusive and exclusive or can be illustrated in a Venn, as shown below.    A previous generic Venn diagram showing 2 ovelapping sets, set A and set B. The yellow crescent is labeled Just A, the blue crescent is labeled Just B, and the green intersection is labeled A and B. The inclusive or includes all 3 regions; the exclusive or is just the yellow and blue regions.       Illustrating Data  We can also use Venn diagrams to illustrate quantities, data, or frequencies.    A survey asks 200 people, What beverage(s) do you drink in the morning? and offers three choices: tea only, coffee only, and both coffee and tea. Thirty report drinking only tea in the morning, 80 report drinking only coffee in the morning, and 40 report drinking both. How many people drink tea in the morning? How many people drink neither tea nor coffee?    To answer this question, let's first create a Venn diagram representing the survey results. Placing the given values, we have the following:    A Venn diagram with 2 overlapping sets, labeled coffee and tea; There are 80 people in the crescent for only coffee only, 30 people in the crescent for only tea, and 40 in the overlapping region in the center for coffee and tea    The universal set should include all 200 people surveyed, but we only have 150 placed so far. The difference between what we have placed so far, and the 200 total is the number of people who drink neither coffee nor tea. These 200 – 150 = 50 people are placed outside of the circles but within the rectangle since they are still included in the universal set.  The number of people who drink tea in the morning includes everyone in the tea circle. This includes those who only drink tea and those who drink both tea and coffee. Thus, the number of people who drink tea is 40 + 30 = 70.    The same Venn digram with the number 50 placed outside of the circles and inside the universal set. These are the people who don't drink tea or coffee      Here is an example of a Venn diagram with three sets.    In a survey, adults were asked how they travel to work. Below is the recorded data on how many people took the bus, biked, and\/or drove to work. Draw and label a Venn diagram using the information in the table.     Travel Options  Frequency    Just Car  157    Just Bike  20    Just Bus  35    Car and Bike only  35    Car and Bus only  10    Bus and Bike only  8    Car, Bus and Bike  12    Neither Car, Bus nor Bike  15    Total  292       To fill in the Venn diagram, we will place the 157 people who only drive a car in the car set where it does not overlap with any other modes of transportation. We can fill in the numbers 20 and 35 in a similar way.  Then we have the overlap of two modes of transportation only. There are 35 people who use their car and bike only, so they go in the overlap of those two sets, but they do not take the bus, so they are outside of the bus set. Similarly, we can enter the 10 and 8. There are 12 people who use all three modes, so they are in the intersection of all three sets. There are 15 people who do not use any of the three modes, so they are placed outside the circles but inside the universal set of all modes of transportation. Here is the completed Venn diagram.    A Venn diagram with 3 overlapping circles labeled bus, car and bike; The numbers are places as in the text: bus only, 35; car only, 57; bike only, 20; bus and car only, 10, bus and bike only, 8; bike and car only, 35; the center region for all 3 modes of transportation has 12. The region outside the circles has 15 people        One hundred fifty people were surveyed and asked if they believed in UFOs, ghosts, and Bigfoot. The following results were recorded.   43 believed in UFOs    44 believed in ghosts    25 believed in Bigfoot    10 believed in UFOs and ghosts    8 believed in ghosts and Bigfoot    5 believed in UFOs and Bigfoot    2 believed in all three     Draw and label a Venn diagram to determine how many people believed in at least two of these things.    Starting with the intersection of all three circles, we work our way out. The number in the center is 2, since two people believe in UFO's, ghosts and Bigfoot. Since 10 people believe in UFOs and Ghosts, and that includes the 2 that believe in all three, that leaves 8 that believe in only UFOs and Ghosts.  We work our way out, filling in all the regions. Once we have, we can add up all those regions, getting 91 people in the union of all three sets. This leaves 150 – 91 = 59 who believe in none.    A Venn diagram with 3 overlapping circles labeled bigfoot, UFO's and ghosts; The numbers are places as in the text: bigfoot only, 14; UFO's only, 30; ghosts only, 28; bigfooot and UFO's only, 3; bigfoot and ghosts only, 6; UFO's and ghosts only, 8; the center region overlapping all 3 has 2. The region outside the circles has 59 people    Then to answer the question of how many people believed in at least two (two or more), we add up the numbers in the intersections, 8 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 19 people.      Qualified Propositions  A qualified proposition is a statement that asserts a relationship between two sets. The three relationships we will be looking at in this section are some (some elements are shared between the two sets), none (none of the elements are shared between the two sets), and all (all elements of one set are contained in the other set). These relationships are especially important in evaluating arguments.    Overlapping Sets  Sets overlap if they have members in common. The Venn diagram examples we have looked at in this section are overlapping sets.     The set of students living in SE Portland and the set of students taking MTH 105.  Qualified Proposition: Some students who live in SE Portland take MTH 105.     A set diagram showing 2 overlapping sets, students in SE portland and students in Math 105; the overlapping region is students who live in SE and are taking Math 105; the rectangle is labeled with U for the universal set       Disjoint Sets  Sets are disjoint if they have no members in common.     The set of Cats and the set of Dogs.  Qualified Proposition: No cats are Dogs.     A set diagram showing 2 sets that are entirely separate, cats and dogs. The circles do not overlap but they are in the universal set rectangle       Subsets  If a set is completely contained in another set, it is called a subset .     The set of all Trees and the set of Maples Trees.  Qualified Proposition: All Maples are Trees.     A set diagram showing the circle for the set maple trees inside the circle for the set of trees. Both are inside the universal rectangle, U       Exercises   List the elements of the set The letters of the word Mississippi.    {m, i, s, p}    List the elements of the set Months of the year.    {January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December}    Write a verbal description of the set {3, 6, 9}.   The set containing multiples of 3 from 3 to 9    Write a verbal description of the set {a, i, e, o, u}.   The set containing vowels    Is {1, 3, 5} a subset of the set of odd numbers?   Yes, {1, 3, 5} a subset of the set of odd numbers.    Is {A, B, C} a subset of the set of letters of the alphabet?   Yes, {A, B, C} a subset of the set of letters of the alphabet.     Create a Venn diagram to illustrate each of the following:    A survey was given asking whether people watch movies at home from Netflix, Redbox, or Disney+. Use the results to determine how many people use Redbox.    only use Netflix, only use Redbox     only use Disney+, use only Disney+ and Redbox     use only Netflix and Redbox, use only Disney+ and Netflix     use all three, use none of these           A survey asked buyers whether color, size, or brand influenced their choice of cell phone. The results are below. How many people were influenced by brand?    said only color, said only size     said only brand, said only color and size     said only color and brand, said only size and brand     said all three, said none of these           Use the given information to complete a Venn diagram, then determine: a) how many students have seen exactly one of these movies, and b) how many have seen only Star Wars Episode IX.    have seen Inception (I) , have seen Star Wars Episode IX (SW)      have seen Vanilla Sky (VS) , have seen I and SW      have seen VS and SW , have seen I and VS      have seen all three     have seen none of these            Twenty-four students have seen exactly one of these movies.    Nineteen students have only seen Star Wars Episode IX.       A survey asked 100 people what alternative transportation modes they use. Use the data to complete a Venn diagram, then determine: a) what percentage of people only ride the bus, and b) how many people don't use any alternate transportation.   40 use the bus, 25 ride a bicycle, and 33 walk    7 use the bus and ride a bicycle    15 ride a bicycle and walk, 20 use the bus and walk    5 use all three modes of alternate transportation            18% of the people (eighteen people) only ride the bus.    Thirty-nine people don't use any alternate transportation.         Given the qualified propositions:   Determine the two sets being described.    Determine if the sets described are Subsets, Overlapping Sets or Disjoint sets.    illustrate the situation using sets.       All Terriers are dogs.      Terriers and dogs    Subsets            Some Mammals Swim. (The second set is not clearly defined but is implied)      Mammals and Things that swim    Overlapping            No pigs can fly.

There are at least two ways this can be interpreted. Friends and people that remember your birthday OR friends and friends that remember my birthday.    Overlapping or subset (depending on how this is interpreted)               No lies are truths.      Lies and truths    disjoint             Suppose someone wants to conduct a study to learn how teenage employment rates differ among gender identities and honor roll status. For each teenager in the study, they will need to record the answers to these three questions:   How does the teenager identify their gender?    Is the teenager an honor student or not?    Is the teenager employed or not?     Explain what each of the regions in the following Venn Diagram represent.

To create a Venn diagram showing the relationship between the set of books Julio read and the set of books Rose read, first draw a rectangle to illustrate the universal set of all books.  Next draw two overlapping circles, one for the set of books Julio read and one for the set of books Rose read.

Thirty report drinking only tea in the morning, 80 report drinking only coffee in the morning, and 40 report drinking both. How many people drink tea in the morning? How many people drink neither tea nor coffee?    To answer this question, let's first create a Venn diagram representing the survey results. Placing the given values, we have the following:    A Venn diagram with 2 overlapping sets, labeled coffee and tea; There are 80 people in the crescent for only coffee only, 30 people in the crescent for only tea, and 40 in the overlapping region in the center for coffee and tea    The universal set should include all 200 people surveyed, but we only have 150 placed so far. The difference between what we have placed so far, and the 200 total is the number of people who drink neither coffee nor tea. These 200 – 150 = 50 people are placed outside of the circles but within the rectangle since they are still included in the universal set.  The number of people who drink tea in the morning includes everyone in the tea circle. This includes those who only drink tea and those who drink both tea and coffee. Thus, the number of people who drink tea is 40 + 30 = 70.    The same Venn digram with the number 50 placed outside of the circles and inside the universal set.

  "body": " Describing and Critiquing Arguments   Describing and Critiquing Arguments.   Students will be able to:     Understand the structure of logical arguments by identifying the premise(s) and conclusion    Distinguish between inductive and deductive arguments    Make a set diagram to evaluate deductive arguments    Determine whether a deductive argument is valid and\/or sound       Alternative Video Lessons      Logical Arguments  A logical argument is a claim that a set of premises support a conclusion . It is possible for a logical argument to have one or many premises, but there must be one conclusion. In this section we will look at types of arguments and how to determine the strength, validity and\/or soundness of each type. There are two types of arguments we will explore in this section: inductive and deductive arguments.    Inductive and Deductive Arguments  To better understand the difference between inductive and deductive arguments, let's start by looking at a couple of examples.   Consider the following argument:  When I went to the store last week, I forgot my wallet, and I forgot it again when I went back today. I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.  Before we analyze an argument, it is helpful to precisely state its premises and its conclusion. Most arguments you encounter in the real world won't be stated in a precise premise, premise, conclusion form. Sometimes the conclusion will be stated before the premises, or the premises will be hidden within a bunch of rhetoric.  To begin our analysis of this first argument, let's first rewrite it in a more precise premise, premise, conclusion form.  Premise: I forgot my wallet when I went to the store last week.  Premise: I forgot my wallet when I went to the store today.  Conclusion: I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.  Notice that both premises make a claim about a specific instance – the specific instance last week when I forgot my wallet, and the specific instance today when I forgot my wallet. The conclusion, on the other hand, states what we can expect to happen more generally.   Now let's consider a different argument:   Henry must know CPR because he is a nurse and all nurses know CPR.  Just as we did for the last example, let's rewrite the argument in its premise, premise, conclusion form:  Premise: All nurses know CPR.  Premise: Henry is a nurse.  Conclusion: Henry knows CPR.  Unlike the first argument where the premises were specific and the conclusion was general, this argument's first premise is a general statement and the conclusion is specific. We can determine whether an argument is inductive or deductive by looking at which part of the argument is general and which is specific. In the first example, the premises were specific and the conclusion was more general. This is an example of an inductive argument. In the second example, it was the premises that were more general and the conclusion that was specific. This is an example of a deductive argument.   In general, an inductive argument uses a collection of specific examples (i.e. data) as its premises and uses them to propose a general conclusion, while a deductive argument uses a collection of general statements (i.e. definitions) as its premises and uses them to propose a specific conclusion . You can see the difference in the pyramids below. We start with the premises at the bottom and build up to the conclusion.    A pyramid upside down with the narrow end at the bottom for a specific premise, the middle section is another specific premise; the wide part at the top is for the general conclusion    A pyramid right-side up with the wide base at the bottom for a general premise; another general premise in the middle section, and a specific conclusion in the narrow part at the top      Rewrite the following arguments in a precise “premise, premise, conclusion” form, and determine if the argument is inductive or deductive.   A number is prime if it is only divisible by itself and one. Since the number 13 is only divisible by itself and one, 13 must be prime.    Juan's dog Goober is having puppies. All three of Goober's previous litters have had 5 puppies so Goober is bound to have 5 puppies in this litter as well.          Premise: If a number is only divisible by itself and one, the number is prime.  Premise: The number 13 is only divisible by itself and one.  Conclusion: 13 is prime.  Since the premises are general definitions and properties of numbers and the conclusion is a specific statement about the number 13, the argument is deductive .    Premise: Goober is having puppies.  Premise: Goober's last three litters had 5 puppies.  Conclusion: Goober's current litter will have 5 puppies.  This is an example of an inductive argument since it uses specific experiences\/instances as its premises, and its conclusion is a general expectation based on those specific experiences.         Evaluating Arguments  Inductive arguments cannot be proven. The best we can do is evaluate the strength of the argument based on the evidence it provides.  A strong inductive argument is one that is well supported by its premises, while a weak inductive argument is one whose premises do a poor job of supporting the conclusion. The strength of an inductive argument is subjective, because where one person sees a strong argument, another may see a weak argument. Additionally, the strength and truth of an argument are not necessarily related; it is possible to have a weak argument that is true, and a strong argument that is false.    Determine the strength of the inductive argument.  James Franco, Jodie Foster, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jack Nicholson have all won Academy Awards for acting. Actors whose names start with J are bound to win an Academy Award.    The inductive argument provides a number of specific cases as evidence for the conclusion. However, we would not be surprised if a J-named actor did not win an Academy Award, so the argument is weak.    Deductive arguments, on the other hand, can be proven and their validity and soundness can be evaluated. The validity of the argument is based on whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises, while the soundness of the argument is based on whether or not the premises are true. An argument cannot be sound if it is not valid, even if the premises seem reasonable.    Evaluating Deductive Arguments Using Sets  One way to determine whether a deductive argument is valid is to illustrate the premises of the argument using sets and see if the conclusion logically follows if we assume the premises to be true.    Use a set diagram to determine whether the argument is valid. If the argument is valid, determine if it is also sound.    All cats are mammals and a tiger is a cat, so a tiger is a mammal.      All water bottles are plastic. This is a water bottle, so it must be plastic.      All firefighters know CPR. Jill knows CPR, so Jill must be a firefighter.      None of my friends like dancing. Kai doesn't like dancing. Therefore, Kai is my friend.      Some young adults make minimum wage and Tara is a young adult. Therefore, Tara makes minimum wage.           First let's write the argument in its premise, premise, conclusion form. For the problems we will be looking at, you will want to write the first premise as a qualified proposition (some, none, all) since this will form the basic structure of our diagram.  Premise: All cats are mammals.  Premise: A tiger is a cat.  Conclusion: A tiger is a mammal.  From the first premise we know that all cats lie inside the set of mammals (cats are a subset of mammals). From the second premise, we know that tigers lie inside the set of cats (marked with an X), and therefore also lie within the set of mammals.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of cats contained within the set of mammals. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is an arrow for tigers pointing to the inside of the cats circle    This argument is valid because we were able to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The argument is also sound since the premises all cats are mammals and a tiger is a cat are true.    From the first premise we know that all water bottles lie inside the set of plastic items (water bottles are a subset of plastic). From the second premise, we know that this particular water bottle must lie within the plastic items set.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of water bottles contained within the set of plastic. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is an arrow for this water bottle pointing to the inside of the water bottle circle    This argument is valid because we were able to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. But the argument is not sound because the premise that all water bottles are plastic is not true. There are many versions of glass and metal bottles that are evidence that the first premise is not true. This argument is valid but not sound.    From the first premise we know that all firefighters lie inside the set of those who know CPR (firefighters are a subset of people who know CPR). From the second premise, we know that Jill is a member of the set of those who know CPR, but we do not have enough information to know whether she is also a member of set of firefighters.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of firefighters contained within the set of those who know CPR. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is a question mark inside the firefighter circle and in the larger know CPR region because we don't know which region Jill is in    Since we cannot determine which group Jill must be a part of, the argument is invalid. The statement that Jill is a firefighter does not follow logically from the premises that all firefighters know CPR and that Jill knows CPR . Since the argument is not valid, it cannot be sound.      A set diagram with 2 disjoint sets, people who like to dance and my friends; Both circles are in the universal set rectangle; There is a question mark in the my friends circle and in the region outside the circles because we don't know where Kai goes.    Because it said none we draw disjoint sets – one set for my friends and a second set for people who like to dance. The second premise tells us that Kai doesn't like to dance so they're not in the set of people who like to dance. However, we can't put Kai in the set of my friends either. They could be my friend, or someone I don't know who happens to not like dancing. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid . And therefore, the arguement is also not sound .      A set diagram with 2 overlapping sets, young adults and minimum wage earners; There is a question mark in the young adults region and in the intersection of the two circles because we don't know where Tara goes.    Because it said some we draw overlapping sets. The second premise tells us to put Tara in the set of young adults, but it doesn't tell us if she makes minimum wage or not. So, like the previous example we cannot determine which region she is in. She could make minimum wage, or she could also make more. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid and therefore, not sound .         Exercises   Write whether the argument described is inductive or deductive:     The first five terms of the sequence were all odd, therefore the sixth term will also be odd.    My dog is afraid of loud noises. Today is the fourth of July, so there will be fireworks. My dog will be afraid today.         The argument is inductive.    The argument is deductive.       Find the next term of the sequences below.     3, 6, 9, 12, 15,     3, 6, 9, 15, 24,          The next term is 18.    The next term is 39.        Rewrite each of the following arguments in their premise, premise, conclusion form, and determine whether the argument is inductive or deductive. If the argument is inductive, determine its strength. If the argument is deductive, use sets to illustrate and determine the validity of the argument, and state whether the argument is valid and whether it is sound.    Since all cats are scared of vacuum cleaners and Max is a cat, Max must be scared of vacuum cleaners.   Premise: All cats are scared of vacuum cleaners.  Premise: Max is a cat.  Conclusion: Max must be scared of vacuum cleaners.  This is a deductive argument. It is valid. However, it is not sound because the premise all cats are afraid of vacuum cleaners is false. While many cats are afraid of vacuum cleaners not ALL cats are afraid. There are many videos of cats riding electronic vacuum cleaners.        Every day for the last year, a plane flew over my house at 2 pm. Therefore, a plane will always fly over my house at 2pm.   Premise: Every day for the last year, a plane flew over my house at 2pm.  Conclusion: A plane will always fly over my house at 2pm.  This is an inductive argument. It is a strong argument because a large quantity of data has been collected.    Kiran collected data on the salaries of their friends. They found that female and nonbinary friends made less than male friends, so they concluded that women and nonbinary people make less than men.   Premise: Kiran's female and nonbinary friends made less than Kiran's male friends.  Conclusion: Women and nonbinary people make less than men.  This is an inductive argument. Kiran did not gather a large diverse sample because they only asked their friends. Therefore, their data has sampling bias. This makes their argument weak.    Some of these kids are rude. Jimmy is one of these kids. Therefore, Jimmy is rude!   Premise: Some of these kids are rude.  Premise: Jimmy is one of these kids.  Conclusion: Jimmy is rude!  This is a deductive argument. This argument is not valid. Jimmy could be one of these rude kids, he could also be a kid who is not rude. Because the conclusion is not valid, it is also not sound.        All bicycles have two wheels. My friend's Harley-Davidson has two wheels, so it must be a bicycle.   Premise: All bicycles have two wheels.  Premise: My friend's Harley-Davidson motorcycle has two wheels.  Conclusion: It must be a bicycle.  This is a deductive argument. The argument is not valid. Based on the premises, we know that the friend's Harley-Davidson motorcycle has two wheels, but we do not know whethere or not it is a bicycle. Because it is not valid, it is also not sound.        Since all chocolate contains milk and this bar is made of chocolate, it must contain milk.   Premise: All chocolate contains milk.  Premise: This bar is made of chocolate.  Conclusion: It must contain milk.  This is a deductive argument. The argument is valid. This bar is in the set of chocolate and chocolate is in the set of things that contain milk. However, this conclusion is not sound because not all chocolate contains milk.        All students drink a lot of caffeine. Brayer drinks a lot of caffeine, so he must be a student.   Premise: All students drink a lot of caffeine.  Premise: Brayer drinks a lot of caffeine.  Conclusion: He must be a student.  This is a deductive argument. The argument is not valid. We can not determine if Brayer is a student or not. Because it is not valid it is also not sound.        Over the course of a year, data was collected on the number of students visiting the cafeteria. On average, there were 15-35 students present in the cafeteria during the peak hours of the data. We can expect there to be between 15 and 35 students in the cafeteria if we go during the peak hours of the day.   Premise: Over one year on average, there were 15-35 students present in the cafeteria during the peak hours.  Conclusion: There is going to be between 15 and 35 students in the cafeteria if we go during the peak hours of the day.  This is an inductive argument. This argument is strong because the conclusion is supported by the premises, they gathered a large amount of data over a long period of time on week days.    If a person is on this reality show, they must be self-absorbed. Laura is not self-absorbed. Therefore, Laura cannot be on this reality show.   Premise: People on this reality show are self-absorbed.  Premise: Laura is not self-absorbed.  Conclusion: Laura cannot be on this reality show.  This argument is deductive. The argument is valid because Laura is outside of the set of self-absorbed people, so she must also be outside of this set of people on this reality show. Determining if this conclusion is sound is more difficult because determining if someone is self-absorbed is subjective.        The first few terms of the sequence are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Therefore, the next term will be 11.   This is a strong inductive argument because we are given specific numbers in which we can find a pattern. Then based on that pattern we can determine that the next term of the sequence would be 11.      For each of the following, draw the appropriate illustration of sets (Subset, Disjoint or Overlapping). Then put an X to represent the subject of the conclusion or put two question marks to illustrate the subject could into two locations. Finally, state if the argument is valid and whether it is sound.    Premise: No apples are pears.  Premise: A Pink Lady is an apple.  Conclusion: Therefore, a Pink Lady is not a pear.   The argument is valid and sound.        Premise: All children are young.  Premise: Tamika is young.  Conclusion: Therefore, Tamika is a child.   The argument is not valid, and it is not sound.        Premise: Some goats faint.  Premise: Fizzy faints.  Conclusion: Therefore, Fizzy is a goat.   The argument is not valid, and it is not sound.        Premise: All students who miss more than 25% of class time fail.  Premise: Claudia failed my class.  Conclusion: Claudia missed more than 25% of class time.   This argument is not valid, and because it is not valid it is also not sound. Claudia could have missed 25% of the classes causing her to fail. She could instead be failing because of low test scores.        Premise: All students who miss more than 25% of class time fail.  Premise: Ethan missed more than 25% of class time.  Conclusion: Ethan failed.   This argument is valid, and it is sound. Because Ethan is in the set of folks who missed 25% of the classes he also falls into the set of failing.        Premise: All dogs eat apples.  Premise: Mary ate an apple.  Conclusion: Mary is a dog.   This argument is not valid, and because it is not valid it is also not sound. Mary could be a dog. Mary could also be a worm, horse or human.        Premise: Some entering freshmen have to take a placement test.  Premise: Juan is an entering freshman.  Conclusion: Juan has to take a placement test.   This argument is not valid, and is not sound. We cannot determine if Juan took the test.        Premise: No cats like peanut butter.  Premise: Bob does not like peanut butter.  Conclusion: Bob is a cat.   This argument is not valid. Because it is not valid, it is also not sound. We cannot determine if Bob is a cat or not.         "

  "body": " Consider the following argument:  When I went to the store last week, I forgot my wallet, and I forgot it again when I went back today. I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.  Before we analyze an argument, it is helpful to precisely state its premises and its conclusion. Most arguments you encounter in the real world won't be stated in a precise premise, premise, conclusion form. Sometimes the conclusion will be stated before the premises, or the premises will be hidden within a bunch of rhetoric.  To begin our analysis of this first argument, let's first rewrite it in a more precise premise, premise, conclusion form.  Premise: I forgot my wallet when I went to the store last week.  Premise: I forgot my wallet when I went to the store today.  Conclusion: I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.  Notice that both premises make a claim about a specific instance – the specific instance last week when I forgot my wallet, and the specific instance today when I forgot my wallet. The conclusion, on the other hand, states what we can expect to happen more generally.  "

Just as we did for the last example, let's rewrite the argument in its premise, premise, conclusion form:  Premise: All nurses know CPR.  Premise: Henry is a nurse.  Conclusion: Henry knows CPR.  Unlike the first argument where the premises were specific and the conclusion was general, this argument's first premise is a general statement and the conclusion is specific. We can determine whether an argument is inductive or deductive by looking at which part of the argument is general and which is specific. In the first example, the premises were specific and the conclusion was more general. This is an example of an inductive argument. In the second example, it was the premises that were more general and the conclusion that was specific. This is an example of a deductive argument.  "

A number is prime if it is only divisible by itself and one. Since the number 13 is only divisible by itself and one, 13 must be prime.    Juan's dog Goober is having puppies. All three of Goober's previous litters have had 5 puppies so Goober is bound to have 5 puppies in this litter as well.          Premise: If a number is only divisible by itself and one, the number is prime.  Premise: The number 13 is only divisible by itself and one.  Conclusion: 13 is prime.  Since the premises are general definitions and properties of numbers and the conclusion is a specific statement about the number 13, the argument is deductive .    Premise: Goober is having puppies.  Premise: Goober's last three litters had 5 puppies.  Conclusion: Goober's current litter will have 5 puppies.  This is an example of an inductive argument since it uses specific experiences\/instances as its premises, and its conclusion is a general expectation based on those specific experiences.      "

  "body": "  Use a set diagram to determine whether the argument is valid. If the argument is valid, determine if it is also sound.    All cats are mammals and a tiger is a cat, so a tiger is a mammal.      All water bottles are plastic. This is a water bottle, so it must be plastic.      All firefighters know CPR. Jill knows CPR, so Jill must be a firefighter.      None of my friends like dancing. Kai doesn't like dancing. Therefore, Kai is my friend.      Some young adults make minimum wage and Tara is a young adult. Therefore, Tara makes minimum wage.           First let's write the argument in its premise, premise, conclusion form. For the problems we will be looking at, you will want to write the first premise as a qualified proposition (some, none, all) since this will form the basic structure of our diagram.  Premise: All cats are mammals.  Premise: A tiger is a cat.  Conclusion: A tiger is a mammal.  From the first premise we know that all cats lie inside the set of mammals (cats are a subset of mammals). From the second premise, we know that tigers lie inside the set of cats (marked with an X), and therefore also lie within the set of mammals.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of cats contained within the set of mammals. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is an arrow for tigers pointing to the inside of the cats circle    This argument is valid because we were able to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The argument is also sound since the premises all cats are mammals and a tiger is a cat are true.    From the first premise we know that all water bottles lie inside the set of plastic items (water bottles are a subset of plastic). From the second premise, we know that this particular water bottle must lie within the plastic items set.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of water bottles contained within the set of plastic. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is an arrow for this water bottle pointing to the inside of the water bottle circle    This argument is valid because we were able to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. But the argument is not sound because the premise that all water bottles are plastic is not true. There are many versions of glass and metal bottles that are evidence that the first premise is not true. This argument is valid but not sound.    From the first premise we know that all firefighters lie inside the set of those who know CPR (firefighters are a subset of people who know CPR). From the second premise, we know that Jill is a member of the set of those who know CPR, but we do not have enough information to know whether she is also a member of set of firefighters.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of firefighters contained within the set of those who know CPR. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is a question mark inside the firefighter circle and in the larger know CPR region because we don't know which region Jill is in    Since we cannot determine which group Jill must be a part of, the argument is invalid. The statement that Jill is a firefighter does not follow logically from the premises that all firefighters know CPR and that Jill knows CPR . Since the argument is not valid, it cannot be sound.      A set diagram with 2 disjoint sets, people who like to dance and my friends; Both circles are in the universal set rectangle; There is a question mark in the my friends circle and in the region outside the circles because we don't know where Kai goes.    Because it said none we draw disjoint sets – one set for my friends and a second set for people who like to dance. The second premise tells us that Kai doesn't like to dance so they're not in the set of people who like to dance. However, we can't put Kai in the set of my friends either. They could be my friend, or someone I don't know who happens to not like dancing. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid . And therefore, the arguement is also not sound .      A set diagram with 2 overlapping sets, young adults and minimum wage earners; There is a question mark in the young adults region and in the intersection of the two circles because we don't know where Tara goes.    Because it said some we draw overlapping sets. The second premise tells us to put Tara in the set of young adults, but it doesn't tell us if she makes minimum wage or not. So, like the previous example we cannot determine which region she is in. She could make minimum wage, or she could also make more. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid and therefore, not sound .      "

  "title": "Logical Fallacies",
  "body": " Logical Fallacies   Logical Fallacies.   Students will be able to:     Identify common logical fallacies and their use in arguments      Logical Fallacies  In the last section we saw that logical arguments are invalid when the premises are not sufficient to guarantee the conclusion, and that even if an argument is valid it may be unsound if the premises are not true. There are other ways that a logical argument my by invalid or unsound. One of the more common ways this can occur is if the argument is a fallacy .  A fallacy is a type of argument that appears valid but uses a logical error to persuade or deceive. Fallacious arguments are especially common in advertising and politics, so it is important as informed citizens to recognize when we are being presented with a fallacious argument and to not be persuaded by it.    Common Logical Fallacies  There are many logical fallacies, and some go by more than one name. Below we introduce a few of the more common fallacies that you will be asked to recognize by name, but there are many others.    Personal Attack (Ad hominem)  A personal attack argument attacks the person making the argument while ignoring the argument itself. A personal attack is not the same as an insult. Rather, a personal attack claims that there is something wrong with the person or group in order to cast doubt on their character and discredit their argument.    Jane says that whales are fish, but she's only in the second grade so she can't be right.   Here the argument is attacking Jane, not the validity of her claim, so this is a personal attack.     Jane says that whales are fish, but everyone knows that they're really mammals. She's so stupid.   This certainly isn't very nice, but it is not a personal attack since a valid counterargument is made ( they really are mammals ) along with a personal insult.     Mr. Smith is a college dropout, so his stance on education reform cannot be trusted.   Here the argument uses the fact that Mr. Smith did not complete their college degree to discredit their ideas on education reform, so it is a personal attack.     Appeal to Ignorance  An appeal to ignorance argument assumes something is true because it hasn't been proven false.    Nobody has proven that photo isn't of Bigfoot, so it must be Bigfoot.   This is an example of an appeal to ignorance since the fact that no one has been able to prove the picture of Bigfoot is false is being used as evidence that it is Bigfoot.     Appeal to Authority  An appeal to authority argument attempts to use the authority of a person to prove a claim. An authority could be an expert such as a doctor or scholar, or someone who is admired like a celebrity or sports figure. While an authority can provide strength to an argument, problems can occur when the person's opinion is not shared by other experts, or when the authority is irrelevant to the claim.    A diet high in bacon can be healthy; Doctor Atkins said so.   Here, an appeal to a doctor's authority is used for the argument. This generally would provide strength to the argument, except that the opinion that eating a diet high in saturated fat runs counter to general medical opinion. More supporting evidence would be needed to justify this claim.     Jennifer Hudson and Oprah lost weight with Weight Watchers, so their program must work.   In this example there is an appeal to the authority of celebrities. While their experience does provide evidence, it provides no more than any other person's experience would.     False Dilemma  A false dilemma argument falsely frames an argument as an either or choice without allowing for additional options.    Either those lights in the sky were an airplane or aliens. There are no airplanes scheduled for tonight, so it must be aliens.   This argument is a false dilemma since it ignores the possibility that the lights could be something other than an airplane or aliens.     Straw Man (or Straw Person)  A straw person argument involves misrepresenting the argument in an oversimplified, distorted and less favorable way to make it easier to attack.    Senator Khouri has proposed reducing military spending by 10%. Apparently, she wants to leave us defenseless against attacks by terrorists.   Here the arguer has represented a 10% funding cut as equivalent to leaving us defenseless, making it easier to attack Senator Khouri's position.     Post Hoc  A post hoc argument claims that because two things happened sequentially, then the first must have caused the second.    Every morning the rooster crows just before dawn. It must be his crow that makes the sun rise.   Here the arguer is saying the rooster caused the sun to rise, but it is more likely that the sun rising caused the rooster to crow.     Today I wore a red shirt and my football team won! I need to wear a red shirt every time they play to make sure they keep winning.   This person is saying their team won because they wore a red shirt. This type of superstition is quite common in sports even though we really know they are unrelated.   Sometimes there may be more than one fallacy that seems reasonable. Consider this argument: Emma Watson says she's a feminist, but she posed for these racy pictures. I'm a feminist and no self-respecting feminist would do that. Could this be ad hominem, saying that Emma Watson has no self-respect? Could it be appealing to authority because the person making the argument claims to be a feminist? Could it be a false dilemma because the argument assumes that a woman is either a feminist or not, with no gray area in between?  We have described just six of the many types of logical fallacies. Once you learn to recognize these you will also likely become aware of many others. There are many lists of logical fallacies online.    Exercises    Determine which type of fallacy each argument represents.    John Bardeen's work at the Advanced Institute for Physics has progressed so slowly that even his colleagues call him a plodder. Hence, it is prudent at present not to take seriously his current theory relating how strings constitute the smallest of subatomic particles.   Personal attack    You will tell the general manager that I made the right choice in dealing with that customer. After all, I'm the shift manager, so my decisions are always right.   Appeal to authority    It was his fault, Officer. You can tell by the kind of car I'm driving and by my clothes that I am a good citizen and would not lie. Look at the rattletrap he is driving and look at how he is dressed. You can't believe anything a dirty, longhaired hippie like that might tell you. Search his car; he probably has pot in it.   Personal Dilemma    We can go to the amusement park or the library. The amusement park is too expensive, so we must go to the library.   False dilemma    Nearly all heroin addicts used marijuana before trying heroin. Clearly marijuana use leads to heroin addiction.   Post Hoc    The oven was working fine until you started using it, so you must have broken it.   Post Hoc    Old man Brown claims that he saw a flying saucer in his farm, but he never got beyond the fourth grade in school and can hardly read or write. He is completely ignorant of what scientists have written on the subject, so his report cannot possibly be true.   Personal Attack    You should use Sparkle brand toothpaste since four out of five dentists recommend it.   Appeal to authority    She didn't say that I couldn't borrow her car, so I figured it was fine if I borrowed it for the weekend.   Appeal to ignorance    If you think that teens should be taught about contraceptive measures then you want to give kids license to have sex with no consequences.   Straw person    You're either part of the solution or part of the problem.   False dilemma    No one can prove that God exists, therefore God does not exist.   Appeal to ignorance    You're clearly just too young to understand.   Personal attack    You should start off every morning with Champions brand cereal. It is what Michael Jordan eats, so you know that it must be very good for you.   Appeal to authority    No one on the council objected to the idea that he proposed, so everyone must think it is a good idea.   Appeal to ignorance    Why should we believe your testimony? You haven't had a steady job since 2003.   Personal attack    A huge percentage of diagnosed cases of autism came very soon after vaccinations for the measles. These vaccinations must be causing autism.   Post Hoc    If you are against this war then you must hate America.   Straw person    Just look at her face. How could anyone vote for that?   Personal Attack     There are a number of fallacies that were not discussed in this section. Do an internet search for the following fallacies. Provide both a definition and at least one example.   Slippery Slope    Circular Reasoning    Appeal to Emotion    Red Herring    Whataboutism      Answers will vary.    "

  "body": " Introduction to Spreadsheets   Introduction to Spreadsheets   Students will be able to:     Perform basic calculations on a spreadsheet    Use cell references and the fill-down feature      A spreadsheet such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel, is a very useful tool for doing calculations and making complex tables. You can type in your own custom calculations or use the built-in formulas.  The rectangles within a spreadsheet are called cells , and they can be referenced by their column letter and row number. The first cell in the upper left side highlighted below is A1. If we wanted to talk about the third column and the fifth row, that cell would be C5.    A blank spreadsheet with the cell A1 highlighted    A spreadsheet file can contain many sheets. Look along the bottom to see if there is more than one sheet and make sure you are on the right sheet.    A blank spreadsheet showing the sheet tabs at the bottom of the screen.      Basic Calculations  To do a calculation on a spreadsheet, type an equal sign before the operation. This lets the program know that you want it to calculate the result. When you press enter, you will see the result.       To add 3 + 4, enter =3+4     To subtract 100-76, enter =100-76     To multiply 4 times 18, enter =4*18     To divide 0.05 by 12, enter =0.05\/12     To calculate , enter =5^25       A spreadsheet showing the examples entered in the spreadsheet. cell A1 has =3+4, cell A2 has =100-76, cell A3 has =4*18, cell A4 has =0.05\/12 and cell A5 has =5^25.     Note that the asterisk (*) is used for multiplication. Spreadsheets don't recognize parentheses as indicators of multiplication like calculators do, so even if you have parentheses for the order of operations, the asterisk is also needed.  You can make more complicated mathematical expressions using parentheses and other operations. To edit a cell click on the editing box at the top, or double click on the cell to edit it directly.    Your bill at a restaurant is $35.75 and you want to leave an 18% tip. How much would you add to the bill?    To work with a percentage, we need to convert it into a decimal first, and then multiply it by the base amount.  In a spreadsheet we would type =0.18*35.75   and get a result of $6.44, rounded to the nearest cent . You would leave a tip of $6.44.      Cell References  One of the powerful things about spreadsheets is using a cell reference, such as C5 in a calculation. When you use a cell reference , the values will automatically update if any of the referenced values change.  Let's make a spreadsheet for the percentage tip example above. We calculated an 18% tip on a bill of $35.75. We might want to tip 18% in general, but our bill will change values. We labeled the first column Bill Amount and the second column Tip. The amount of $35.75 is entered in cell A2. Then when we write our formula in B2, we want to calculate 18% of A2. That way if the number in A2 changes, our tip will automatically update.    A spreadsheet showing a formula with a cell reference, =0.18*A2    The formula =0.18*A2 is entered in B2 which gives a result of $6.44 when you hit enter.    The same spreadsheet showing when the input in A1 is changed to $45, the answer to the formula changes to $8.10.    When the bill amount is changed, the tip is recalculated.    Cell Formatting  We can also format cells A1 and B1 to show dollar signs by clicking on the dollar sign in the number formatting menu.    Fill-Down Feature  The fill-down feature is very useful for making tables. This allows us to copy values or formulas to save time. Let's make a tipping reference table with values from $10, to$100, in increments of $10. First, we will enter two values in column A to establish the pattern. Then select those two cells and you will see a small square in the lower right corner. Drag that square down until you get to $100.    A spreadsheet showing the fill-down feature; cells A2 and A3 are highligted for the pattern and there is a down arrow by the small square to drag down.      This spreadsheet shows the completed bill amount column from $10 to $100 and shows the fill-down feature for the formula; cell B2 has the equation =0.18*A2 and there is a down arrow by the small square to drag down.    Next, we can drag our formula down and the cell reference will change to each row number automatically.  Here are the formulas with the row numbers updated:    This spreadsheet shows the result of filling down the formula. The cell reference changes for each new row.    Here is our completed table with the calculations:    This spreadsheet shows the calculated values for tips from $10-100.      Formulas  Spreadsheets have many useful built-in formulas. We will introduce some of the financial formulas in this chapter. Here are some of the formulas we will use:    =FV to calculate the future values of an investment     =PV to calculate the deposit needed for a desired future balance     =PMT to calculate a loan or savings plan payment     =EFFECT to calculate the effective rate of an account and compare accounts     In the rest of this chapter we will use spreadsheets and formulas to calculate the future values, interest paid or earned and monthly payments.    Exercises   Use a spreadsheet to compute the following.    Convert to a decimal    =4\/7 which gives approximately 0.571429    Convert 16% to a decimal    =16% which gives 0.16    Add 8 and 19    =8+19 which gives 27    Find the difference of 230 and 78    =230-78 which gives 152    Multiply 12 and 9    =12*9 which gives 108    Divide 0.09 by 52    =0.09\/52 which gives approximately 0.001731    Calculate     =8^3 which gives 512    Your bill at a restaurant is $55.75 and you want to leave a 20% tip. How much would you add to the bill?    =55.75*20% which gives $11.15    You leave a tip for $7.50 for a bill at a restaurant that is $44.50. What percent tip did you leave?    =7.50\/44.50 which gives approximately 0.1685, or approximately 16.85%    In Column A use the fill down feature to build a spreadsheet starting with $5 and ending at $125, in increments of $5. In Column B write a formula with a cell reference to calculate a 15.5% tip on the amount in Column A. Use the fill down feature to complete your table.   See the table below:  Note, the entry in cell B1 is =15%*A1 . (Columns A and B are given dollar formatting)    A portion of a spreadsheet is shown which includes cells A1 through B25, and with a title heading of Table 1. Cell A1 shows $5.00, cell A2 shows $10.00, and so on. The pattern shows that each additional cell under A1 is equal to the cell above it, plus $5.00. This pattern continues down to cell A25, which shows $125.00. Cell B1 shows $0.78, which is 15% of the $5.00 amount shown in cell A1. Cell B2 shows $1.55, which is 15% of the $10.00 amount shown in cell A2. This pattern continues until we reach cell B25, which shows $19.38, and which is 15% of the $125.00 amount shown in cell A25.      Imagine a certain savings account started out with a balance of $5250.00 on day-one, and today has a current balance of $5780.23     Exactly how much more money does the account have today, compared with day-one?    Rounding to the nearest tenth of a percent: By what percentage amount has the account balance grown?    If instead, the bank balance today was exactly double the starting balance, then by what exact percentage amount would the bank balance have grown?    If the bank balance today had instead grown by 15.5% since day-one, then what would be the exact amount of today's balance?          =5780.23-5250 which gives $530.23     =530.23\/5250 which gives approximately 0.100996, or approximately 10.1%    Exactly 200%     =5250*115.5% which gives exactly $6063.75       Imagine that at the start of a certain month, you will make an opening deposit of $500 into a savings account, and you will then leave the account alone (meaning you will make no further deposits or withdrawals). Also, for this account: Every month after the opening deposit, the amount in the account will grow to be 101% of its previous month's balance.     Use a spreadsheet to enter 500 in cell A1. Using a formula and a cell-reference: Compute in cell A2, the amount in the account after one month has passed. Then using the fill down feature, continue the pattern for another eleven full months (you should end at cell A13). Format all the cells to show dollar signs. What is the amount in the account after one year?    Now continue the pattern in column A of your spreadsheet to extend for a second full year (you should end at cell A25). What is the amount in the account after two years?    What overall percentage growth occurred in the account between the opening deposit and one year later? (Compute using a formula and cell references)    What overall percentage growth occurred in the account between the end of year one, and the end of year two? (Compute using a formula and cell references)    (Challenge) The annual percentage growth that you found in part (d) for the second year, should be identical to the annual percentage growth that you found in part (c) for the first year. Can you mathematically explain why this is true? Do you think this pattern of identical overall annual percentage growth would continue, if you extend the pattern for even more years?         See the table at the bottom for part a and part b.  After 1 year, the account holds $563.41.    See the table at the bottom for part a and part b.  After 2 years, the account holds $634.87.     =A13\/A1 which gives growth     =A25\/A13 which gives growth (same)    Each starting value increases mathematically by a factor of each year, which is approximately 112.6825%. So yes, this pattern must continue indefinitely into future years.       A portion of a spreadsheet is shown covering cells A1 through A25, and with a title heading of Table 2. Cell A1 shows $500.00. Cell A2 shows $505.00, which is 101% of cell A1. Cell A3 shows $510.05, which is 101% of cell A2. This pattern continues until we reach cell A25, which shows $634.87, and which is 101% of cell A24.      Imagine that at the start of a certain year, you will deposit $1000.00 into a savings account, and then you will leave the account alone. Each year after the opening deposit, the amount in the account will grow to be 103% of its previous year's balance.     After two years, the account balance will have experienced two growth amounts of 103%. You can find this account balance amount here, with the spreadsheet computation = 1000 * (103%) * (103%) . Perform this computation in a spreadsheet and write the balance that you find.    Now enter the spreadsheet computation = 1000 * (103%)^2 . Notice that the result here, which involves using a power, gives the same answer as you found in part (a). Comparing the two spreadsheet computations: Explain why they give the same result.    Using the pattern in part (b) above, and carefully choosing the power: Compute the balance that will be in the account fifteen full years after the account was originally opened. (Round to the nearest cent)    (Challenge) Make a spreadsheet that shows the account balance each individual year for 30 years. From the date of the opening deposit: What minimum number of full years will you have to wait, until the balance finally exceeds twice its opening deposit amount? (Use cell references, the fill down feature, and dollar formatting)    (Challenge) Imagine the opening balance of the account was $5000.00 instead of $1000.00 (and everything else about the account stays the same). Make a similar spreadsheet as you did in part (d), and using this spreadsheet, find the minimum number of full years you will have to wait this time, until the balance finally exceeds twice its opening deposit amount. How does this answer compare with your answer in part (d)? Do you think your answer would be the same here, for any positive opening balance you may choose for the account?          =1000*103%*103% which gives $1060.90     =1000*(103%)^2 gives the same result of $1060.90, because raising 103% to the second power means the same as multiplying 103% by itself two times.     =1000*(103%)^15 which gives $1557.97 rounded to the nearest cent    Refer to the table at the bottom for part d and part e.  Note the entry in cell B3 here is = B2*103% and the remaining cells are computed using the fill down feature.  You will have to wait a minimum of 24 full years, in each case, in order for the balance to finally exceed twice the opening deposit amount.    Since , the minimum number of full years until the opening deposit doubles must be the same here, for any positive opening balance that we may choose for this account.       A portion of a spreadsheet is shown, which includes cells A1 through E32, and with a title heading of Table 3. Cell A1 shows a column title of Year, and cells A2 through A32 contain values of 0 through 30, respectively. Cells D1 through D32 are a copy of cells A1 through A32. Cell B1 shows a column title of Balance. Cell B2 shows $1,000.00, which corresponds to Year 0 displaying in adjacent cell A1. Cell B3 shows $1,030.00, which is 103% of the $1,000 shown in cell B2. Cell B4 shows $1,060.90, which is 103% of the $1,030.00 shown in cell B3. This pattern continues until we get to cell B32, which shows $2,427.26, and which is 103% of the $2,356.57 amount shown in cell B31. Cell E1 shows a column title of Balance. Cell B2 shows $5,000.00, which corresponds to Year 0 displaying in adjacent cell D1. Cell E3 shows $5,150.00, which is 103% of the $5,000 shown in cell E2. Cell E4 shows $5,304.50, which is 103% of the $5,150.00 shown in cell E3. This pattern continues until we get to cell E32, which shows $12,136.31, and which is 103% of the $11,782.83 amount shown in cell E31.      "

Be sure to check with your instructor for which method to use.   Working with money is a very important skill for everyday life. While balancing a checkbook or calculating our monthly expenditures on espresso requires only arithmetic, when we start saving money, planning for retirement, or need a loan, we need more mathematics and tools. In this section we will calculate and compare simple and compound interest.   Alternative Video Lessons      Simple Interest  Calculating interest starts with the principal , P , or the beginning amount in your account. This is also called the present value . This could be a starting investment, or the starting amount of a loan. The interest rate , I , in its most simple form, is a percentage of the principal.  For example, if you borrowed $100 from a friend and agree to repay it with 5% interest, then the amount of interest you would pay would be 5% of 100. It is very important to remember to change the interest rate , r, of 5% into a decimal by moving the decimal two places to the left.     The total amount you would repay is called the future value and would be $105, the original principal plus the interest.     Here are the formulas to represent the calculations we just did.   Simple One-time Interest            is the interest     is the principal, starting amount or present value      is the interest rate in decimal form     is the end amount: principal plus interest. This is also called the future value         A friend asks to borrow $300 and agrees to repay it in 30 days with 3% simple interest. How much interest will you earn?     , the principal or present value   , 3% rate  Using the formula,     To calculate this in a spreadsheet, you would enter =300*0.03 and get a result of $9. You will earn $9 in interest when your friend pays you back.    One-time simple interest is only common for extremely short-term or informal loans. For longer term loans or investments, it is common for interest to be paid on a daily, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. In that case, interest would be earned regularly. Bonds are an example of this type of investment. Bonds are issued by the federal, state or local governments to cover their expenses.    Suppose your city is building a new park, and issues bonds to raise the money to build it. You buy a $1,000 bond that pays 5% simple interest annually and matures in 5 years. How much interest will you earn? What is the future value of the bond?    Each year, you would earn 5% interest so over the course of five years, you would earn:     When the bond matures, you would receive back the $1,000 you originally paid and the $250 in interest, so we could also put that into a single calculation:     Using a spreadsheet, you would enter =1000+1000*0.05 and get a result of $1,250. The future value of the bond is $1,250.    We can generalize this idea of simple interest over time.   Simple Interest over Time            is the interest     is the principal, starting amount, or present value     is the interest rate in decimal form     is time, where the increment of time (years, months, etc.) matches the time period for the interest rate     is the end amount, principal plus interest, or future value        APR – Annual Percentage Rate  Interest rates are usually stated as an annual percentage rate (APR) – the total interest that will be paid in the year. If not stated otherwise, assume that the interest rate is an annual rate or APR. If the interest is paid in smaller time increments, the APR will be divided by the number of time periods.  Note: The Federal Truth in Lending Act requires that every consumer be given the true APR which includes the interest and any fees included.  For example, a 6% APR paid monthly, would be divided by 12, because you would get one twelfth of the rate per month, which is half a percent per month.     A 4% annual rate paid quarterly, would be divided by 4 to get 1% per quarter.     Here is an example of a semi-annual rate.    Suppose you buy a $1,000 federal bond with a 4% annual simple interest rate, paid semi-annually, with a maturity in 4 years. How much interest will you earn? What will be the future value of the bond?     , the principal   , interest is being paid semi-annually (twice a year), so the 4% interest will be divided into two 2% payments.   , 4 years compounded twice a year gives half-years     You will earn $160 in interest over the four years. The future value of the loan is     We could also use a spreadsheet to do this calculation and enter:   =1000+1000*(0.04\/2)*(4*2)   which also gives $1,160. The future value of the bond is $1,160. Remember that spreadsheets don't interpret parentheses as multiplication. We need the asterisks as well as the parentheses.      Compound Interest  In a standard bank account, any interest we earn is automatically added to our balance, and we earn interest on that interest. This reinvestment of interest is called compounding . We will develop the mathematical formula for compound interest and then show the equivalent spreadsheet function.  Suppose that we deposit $1000 in a bank account offering 3% interest, compounded monthly. How will our money grow?  The 3% interest is an annual percentage rate (APR) – the total interest to be paid during the year. Since interest is being paid monthly, each month, we will earn per month.  In the first month,     In the first month, we will earn $2.50 in interest, raising our account balance to $1002.50.  In the second month,     Notice that in the second month we earned more interest than we did in the first month. This is because we earned interest not only on the original $1000 we deposited, but we also earned interest on the $2.50 of interest we earned the first month. This is the key advantage that compounding gives us.  Calculating out a few more months in a table or a spreadsheet we have:     Month  Starting balance  Interest earned  Ending Balance    1  1000.00  2.50  1002.50    2  1002.50  2.51  1005.01    3  1005.01  2.51  1007.52    4  1007.52  2.52  1010.04    5  1010.04  2.53  1012.57    6  1012.57  2.53  1015.10    7  1015.10  2.54  1017.64    8  1017.64  2.54  1020.18    9  1020.18  2.55  1022.73    10  1022.73  2.56  1025.29    11  1025.29  2.56  1027.85    12  1027.85  2.56  1030.42     To find an equation to represent this, we will go through a few months to see the pattern:  Initial Amount:               Observing a pattern, we could conclude     Notice that the $1000 in the equation was P, the starting amount. We found 1.0025 by adding one to the interest rate divided by 12, since we were compounding 12 times per year. Generalizing our result, we could write   Compound Interest        A  is the future value balance in the account after years    P  is the principal or present value    r  is the annual interest rate in decimal form    n  is the number of compounding periods in one year    t  is the number of years      If the compounding is done annually (once a year), .  If the compounding is done quarterly, .  If the compounding is done monthly, .  If the compounding is done weekly, .  If the compounding is done daily, .  The most important thing to remember about using this formula is that it assumes that we put money in the account once and let it sit there earning interest.    The Future Value Spreadsheet Formula  The compound interest formula is built into spreadsheets and is called the future value formula.   Future Value Spreadsheet Formula   =FV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, present value)      rate per period  is the interest rate per compounding period,     number of periods  is the total number of periods,     payment amount  is the amount of regular payments. If none, enter     present value  is the amount deposited or principal,       We will use the payment amount in a future section, for now that will be 0. There is also an optional input at the end to specify making payments at the beginning or end of the period, but we will not use it in this book.  Now let's look at an example and calculate the compound interest using the spreadsheet and the mathematical formula.    A certificate of deposit (CD) is a savings instrument that many banks offer. It usually gives a higher interest rate, but you cannot access your investment for a specified length of time. Suppose you deposit $3000 in a CD paying 6% APR, compounded monthly. How much will you have in the account after 20 years?     , the initial deposit   , 6% annual rate   , 12 months in 1 year   , since we're looking for how much we'll have after 20 years  To use a spreadsheet, we will use the formula like this =FV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, present value)    =FV(0.06\/12, 12*20, 0, 3000)   and get a result of $9,930.61, rounded to the nearest cent.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Note that the output of the formula gives the answer with the opposite sign as the principal and payments. A negative number may be denoted with a negative sign or with the color red or parentheses. The signs may be used in accounting, but we will ignore them in this book.  To use a formula, we are looking for the future value, so we use the formula solved for A:     To use a calculator, you would enter the formulas including parentheses around any inside operations. You would enter   3000(1+(0.06\/12))^(12*20)=$9930.61       Comparing Simple and Compound Interest  Let us compare the amount of money earned from compounding in the previous example against the amount you would earn from simple interest. From the table and graph below we can see that over a long period of time, compounding makes a large difference in the account balance. You may recognize this as the difference between linear growth and exponential growth.       Year  Simple Interest ($15 per month)  Compound Interest (6% compounded monthly or 0.5% each month    0  $3000  $3000    5  $3900  $4046.55    10  $4800  $5458.19    15  $5700  $7362.28    20  $6600  $9930.61    25  $7500  $13394.91    30  $8400  $18067.73    35  $9300  $24370.65      A coordinate graph with years on the x-axis and account balance on the y-axis. The simple interest increases in a straight line; the compound interest curves up faster because it is an exponential function.      Finding the Principal, or Present Value  When we know the amount of money we want to have in the future, we can use the formula that is solved for P . It requires a little algebra to divide both sides of the formula by the quantity that was multiplied by P . There is also a spreadsheet formula which we will introduce now, and then do an example using both methods.    The Present Value Spreadsheet Formula  The present value spreadsheet formula will calculate how much you need to deposit in the present to get a specified future value.   Present Value Spreadsheet Formula   =PV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, future value)      rate per period  is the interest rate per compounding period,     number of periods  is the total number of periods,     payment amount  is the amount of regular payments. If none, enter     future value  is the amount desired in the future,         You know that you will need $40,000 for your child's education in 18 years. If your account earns 4% APR compounded quarterly, how much would you need to deposit now to reach your goal?    We are looking for what we need to deposit now so we will use the present value formula. We type the formula and inputs the same way we used the future value formula.   =PV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, future value)    =PV(0.04\/4, 4*18, 0, 40000)   which gives a value of $19,539.84. You would need to deposit $19,539.84 now and keep the same interest rate to have $40,000 in 18 years.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Note that we cannot enter commas in numbers in a spreadsheet. Commas are used to separate the input values, so we would not get the same answer if we put in $40,000 for an input.  To use the mathematical formula, we use the one that is solved for P .   , 4% APR   , 4 quarters in 1 year   , since we know the balance in 18 years   , the amount we have in 18 years  In this case, we're going to have to set up the equation, and solve for P.     You would need to deposit $19,539.84 now to have $40,000 in 18 years.      Continuously Compounded Interest  In many bank accounts your interest is compounded continuously, or at each moment in time. The number of times per year, n, is infinite. As n approaches infinity the compound interest formula changes to the continuously compounded interest formula.   Continuously Compounded Interest        A  is the future value or desired balance in the account    P  is the principal or present value    r  is the annual interest rate in decimal form    t  is the number of years    e  is an irrational number that is approximately 2.718281828… Find on your calculator to use this formula     To calculate this on a spreadsheet we use the =EXP function. The spreadsheet formulas are   =Principal*EXP(r*t) or =A\/EXP(r*t)      You deposit $4000 in an account that earns 2.75% APR compounded continuously. How much will you have after 7 years? How much interest did you earn? What percentage of the final balance is interest?      To use a spreadsheet, we look at the formula solved for A, the future value. We enter   =4000*EXP(0.0275*7)   and get a result of $4849.11.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To use the formula, we have:      , amount invested   , interest rate   , number of years     After 7 years your account would be worth $4,849.11. Next, we will calculate the amount of interest earned and the percentage.      Finding the Amount of Interest Earned and the Percentage  In the previous example we also want to know how much interest was earned and what percentage of the final balance is from interest. The future value of the investment is $4,849.11. Now to figure out how much of that was interest, we need to subtract the amount initially deposited.   Continued: To find the total amount of interest earned, we subtract the principal from the total balance.     The spreadsheet calculation is   =4849.11-4000   which gives a result of $849.11. You would earn $849.11 in interest.  To find the percentage that is interest, divide the amount of interest by the total amount.     The spreadsheet calculation is the same:   =849.11\/4849.11   which is 0.1751 or 17.5%. This tells us that after 7 years, 17.5% of the account was earned as interest.     Effective Rate  If you are shopping around for different investments, you might need to compare different rates that have different compounding periods. If the rate and period are different, it's hard to know which account will give the better result. There is a spreadsheet formula called =EFFECT which will allow us to compare accounts. This is also sometimes called the annual percentage yield, or APY.   Effective Rate Formula   =EFFECT(stated rate, number of compounding periods)      stated rate  is the interest rate given (APR)    number of compounding periods  is the number of times the account is compounded per year,         You are comparing an account that pays 5.25% APR compounded monthly, with an account that pays 5% APR compounded daily. Which account will earn you more interest?    It is hard to tell whether the higher interest rate will be better or the higher compounding rate in this case. We will find the effective rate of both accounts.  For the 5.25% APR account compounded monthly:     =EFFECT(0.0525,12)   which gives 0.05378 or 5.38%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    For the 5% APR account compounded daily:     =EFFECT(0.05,365)   which gives 0.05127 or 5.13%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Now we can compare the effective rates of 5.38% and 5.13% and see that the account with the higher interest rate will earn more interest in this case. This is not always true, so we will show another example.      Find the effective rates to compare an account that earns 6% APR compounded quarterly with an account that earns 5.975% APR compounded daily. Which one would you choose?    Using the effective rate formula for each, we have:  For the 6% APR account compounded quarterly:     =EFFECT(0.06,4)   which gives 0.06136 or 6.14%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    For the 5.975% APR account compounded daily:     =EFFECT(0.05975,365)   which gives 0.06157 or 6.16%    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    The account that was compounded more often has a slightly higher rate in this case.      Exercises   A friend lends you $200 for a week, which you agree to repay with 5% one-time interest. How much will you have to repay?      You will have to repay $210.    You loan your friend $100. They agree to pay an annual interest rate of 3%, simple interest. Six months later they repay that loan.   How much did they pay you?    How much was interest?                    They paid $101.50 total, $1.50 was interest.    Consider a simple interest loan of $200 with an annual interest rate of 6%. If that loan is paid off 1 year and 3 months later, how much was repaid?      $215 was repaid.    You deposit $1,000 in an account that earns simple interest. The annual interest rate is 2.5%.     How much interest will you earn in 5 years?    How much will you have in the account in 5 years?                  The interest earned was $125. This brings the account balance to $1,125.    Consider an investment of $20000 with an annual interest rate of 5%.   If that investment is earning simple interest, how much will the investment be worth in 10 years?    If that investment is getting annually compounding interest, how much will the investment be worth in 10 years?                    The simple interest account would be worth $30,000 and the account that was compounding would be worth $32,577.89 in ten years.    Nico invests $4,500 into an account that has an annual interest rate of 8.5%. The interest is compounding monthly. Twenty years later what is the account balance?      The account balance is $24,485.59 in 20 years.  Or, =FV(0.085\/12,12*20,0,4500)     How much will $1,000 deposited in an account earning 7% APR compounded weekly be worth in 20 years?      The account balance is $4,051.38 in 20 years.  Or, =FV(0.07\/52,52*20,0,1000)     Suppose you obtain a $3,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) with a 3% APR, paid quarterly, with maturity in 5 years.     What is the future value of the CD in 5 years?    How much interest will you earn?    What percent of the balance is interest?            The future value is $3,483.55.  Or, =FV(0.03\/4,4*5,0,3000)        The interest earned is $483.54.       13.88% of the balance is interest.       You deposit $300 in an account earning 5% APR compounded annually. How much will you have in the account in 10 years?     How much will you have in the account in 10 years?    How much interest will you earn?    What percent of the balance is interest?            There will be $488.67 in the account in 10 years.  Or, =FV(0.05\/1,1*10,0,300)        $188.67 of the balance will be interest.       The interest makes up 38.61% of the balance.       You deposit $2,000 in an account earning 3% APR compounded monthly.     How much will you have in the account in 20 years?    How much interest will you earn?    What percent of the balance is interest?    What percent of the balance is the principal?            The account will have $3,641.51 in 20 years  Or, =FV(0.03\/12,12*20,0,2000)        The interest will be $1641.51.       The interest is 45.08% of the balance.       The principal is 54.92% of the balance.       You deposit $10,000 in an account earning 4% APR compounded weekly.     How much will you have in the account in 25 years?    How much interest will you earn?    What percent of the balance is interest?    What percent of the balance is the principal?            The balance is $27,172.37.  Or, =FV(0.04\/52,52*25,0,10000)        The interest is $17,172.37.       The percent that is interest is 63.2%.       The percentage that is the principal is 36.2%.       How much would you need to deposit in an account now in order to have $6,000 in the account in 8 years? Assume the account earns 6% APR compounded monthly.      The principal required would be $3717.14  Or, =PV(0.06\/12,12*8,0,6000)     How much would you need to deposit in an account now in order to have $20,000 in the account in 4 years? Assume the account earns 5% APR compounded quarterly.      The principal required would be $16,394.79  Or, =PV(0.05\/4,4*4,0,20000)     Breylan invests $1,200 in an account that earns 4.6% APR compounded quarterly and Angad invests the same amount in an account that earns 4.55% APR compounded weekly.     What will their balances be after 15 years?    What will their balances be after 30 years?    What is the effective rate for each account?            Or, =FV(0.046\/52,15*52,0,1200)      Or, =FV(0.0455\/52,15*52,0,1200)   Breylan has an account balance of $2,391.73 and Angad has a balance of $2,373.87       Or, =FV(0.046,52,30*52,0,1200)      Or, =FV(0.0455\/52,30*52,0,1200)   Breylan has an account balance of $4,766.97 and Angad has a balance of $4,696.06    Breylan =EFFECT(0.046,52) , which gives 4.71%  Angad =EFFECT(0.0455,52) , which gives 4.65%  Breylan has an effective rate of 4.71% and Angad has an effective rate of 4.65%.       Bill invests $6,700 in a savings account that compounds interest monthly at 3.75% APR. Ted invests $6,500 in a savings account that compound interest annually at 3.8% APR.     Find the effective rate for each account.    Who will have the higher accumulated balance after 5 years?         Bill =EFFECT(0.0375,12)  and Ted =EFFECT(0.038,1) =3.8%. Bill has an effective rate of 3.82% and Ted has a rate of 3.8%.       Or, =FV(0.0375\/12,5*12,0,6700)      Or, =FV(0.038,5,0,6500)   The account balances are $8,079.38 and $7,832.49. So, Bill's balance is higher.       Bassel is comparing two accounts where one pays 3.45% APR quarterly and the second pays 3.4% APR daily.     What is the effect rate for each?    If he has $5,000 to deposit how much will the balance be in 10 years?          =EFFECT(0.0345,4) = 3.49% and =EFFECT(0.034,365) = 3.46%. The effective rates are 3.49% and 3.46%.       Or, =FV(0.0345\/4,10*4,0,5000)      Or, =FV(0.034\/365,10*365,0,5000)   The account balances are $7,049.51 and $7,024.63.       You deposit $2,500 into an account earning 4% APR compounded continuously.     How much will you have in the account in 10 years?    How much total interest will you earn?

  "body": " Savings Plans   Savings Plans   Students will be able to:     Use a spreadsheet and\/or formula to calculate the future value and interest earned on savings plans    Use a spreadsheet and\/or formula to calculate payment amounts for savings plans    Analyze and compare lump sum and regular payment savings plans      For most of us it is not practical to deposit a large sum of money in the bank. Instead, we save by depositing smaller amounts of money regularly. We might save in an IRA or 401-K for retirement. We might also save for a down payment on a car or house, or in a college savings plan for our children.  Just like the last section, we will emphasize spreadsheets but calculate each example with the formulas as well. Check with your instructor for which way you should do your problems.   Alternative Video Lesson      Savings Plan Formulas  To make calculations for savings plans using a spreadsheet, we can use the =FV formula we have already used. This time for regular payments we will use the field for payment amount. If we are not making an initial deposit, the present value will be zero.  Here is the future value formula again:   Future Value Spreadsheet Formula   =FV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, present value)      rate per period  is the interest rate per compounding period,     number of periods  is the total number of periods,     payment amount  is the amount of regular payments    present value  is the initial principal. If none, enter       The mathematical formulas are shown below. If you want to know how we got the formula, it is derived at the end of the chapter.   Savings Plan Formulas        A  is the balance in the account after n years (future value)    d  is the regular deposit (or payment amount each month, quarter, year, etc.)    r  is the annual interest rate in decimal form    n  is the number of compounding periods in one year    t  is the number of years      If the compounding frequency is not explicitly stated, assume there are the same number of compounds in a year as there are deposits made in a year.  If you make your deposits every year, use yearly compounding, .  If you make your deposits every quarter, use quarterly compounding, .  If you make your deposits every month, use monthly compounding, , etc.  To see how both of these methods work, let's look at an example.    A traditional individual retirement account (IRA) is a special type of retirement account in which the money you invest is exempt from income taxes until you withdraw it. If you deposit $100 each month into an IRA earning 6% APR, how much will you have in the account after 20 years? How much will you have earned in interest? What percentage of the balance is interest?    To use a spreadsheet, we will use =FV because we want to know the balance in the future. We enter 100 for the payment amount and 0 for the present value:     =FV(0.06\/12, 12*20, 100, 0)   which gives a result of $46,204.09.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Remember that the output of the formula gives the answer with the opposite sign as the principal and payments. For our purposes we will ignore the signs. To use the formula, we use the one solved for A , since we want to know the final amount.   , the monthly deposit   , 6% annual rate   , since we're doing monthly deposits, we'll compound monthly   , we want the amount after 20 years  Putting this into the equation we have:     With U.S. dollars we round to the nearest cent. The account will grow to $46,204.09 after 20 years.  To find the amount of interest earned , calculate the total of all your deposits.     The difference between the total amount and the deposits is the interest earned.     The total amount of interest you earned was $22,204.09.  To find the percentage of the balance that is interest we will divide the interest by the total balance.     or 48.1%. After 20 years 48.1% of the balance is from interest.    Now here's an example with an initial deposit and monthly deposits. We can do this with the spreadsheet formula.    You want to jumpstart your saving by depositing $1500 from your tax return and then deposit $150 every month into an account that earns 5.5% APR compounded monthly. How much will you have in the account after 30 years?    Using the spreadsheet formula, we can enter an initial deposit and a monthly payment. We enter     =FV(0.055\/12, 12*30, 150,1500)   and get a result of $144,822.87.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.        Finding Payment Amounts Usings Spreadsheets and Formulas  Another important thing we can calculate is how much we need to save in each period to have a specified amount in the future. Say you want to achieve a certain amount for retirement or for your kids' college.  The mathematical formula for this is the one solved for d, the payment amount, above. There is a new spreadsheet formula to calculate payments, =PMT, that we will introduce now.   Payment Spreadsheet Formula   =PMT(rate per period, number of periods, present value, future value)      rate per period  is the interest rate per compounding period,     number of periods  is the total number of periods,     present value  is the amount deposited or principal,     future value  is the amount you want in the future,       Here is an example of a retirement goal calculated with a spreadsheet and the formula.    You want to have half a million dollars in your account when you retire in 30 years. Your retirement account earns 8% APR. How much do you need to deposit each month to meet your retirement goal?    To calculate this with a spreadsheet, we will use the =PMT function and enter 0 for the present value and $500,000 for the future value. We cannot enter commas within the numbers however, because spreadsheets use commas to separate the inputs. We enter:     =PMT(0.08\/12, 12*30, 0, 500000)   and get a result of $335.49.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To see how this works with the formulas, we use the one solved for d , the regular deposit amount.   , 8% annual rate   , since we're depositing monthly   , 30 years   , the amount we want to have in 30 years      So, you would need to deposit $335.49 each month to have $500,000 in 30 years if your account earns 8% interest.     A note about rounding  If you are using the formulas and round during intermediate steps you will probably have some roundoff error. For this reason, we enter the whole expression into the calculator and do not show the intermediate steps.   One of the challenges in this chapter is choosing the correct formula or spreadsheet function. Read this next example and see if you can determine which formula to use.    A more conservative investment account pays 3% APR. If you deposit $5 a day into this account, how much will you have after 10 years? What amount and percentage are from interest?    In this example we are given the regular deposit amount and we are looking for the future value. In a spreadsheet we use the =FV function and enter:     =FV(0.03\/365, 365*10, 5,0)   which gives a result of $21,282.07.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To use a mathematical formula, we choose the one solved for A :   , the daily deposit   , 3% annual rate   , since we're doing daily deposits, we'll compound daily   , we want the amount after 10 years     To find the amount of interest, we will calculate how much was deposited in the account. Since you put in $5 a day for 10 years we get   .  The interest earned is .  To find the percentage we divide by the total balance to get or 14.25%.  After 10 years, about 14.25% of the account is interest.      Comparing Lump Sum and Regular Savings Payments  Now let's compare two scenarios to do some multistep problems and get a sense for the value of compounding over time.    Scenario 1: Suppose you invest $200 a month for 15 years into an account earning 10% APR compounded monthly. After 15 years, you leave the money, without making additional deposits, in the account for another 20 years. How much will you have in the end?  Scenario 2: Suppose instead you didn't invest anything for the first 15 years, then deposited $200 a month for 20 years into an account earning 10% APR compounded monthly. How much will you have in the end?    Before we calculate the balance for both scenarios, which one do you think will have a higher balance at the end?  For scenario 1, there are two steps involved. The first part is the monthly payments for 15 years. To calculate this with a spreadsheet we enter     =FV(0.10\/12, 12*15, 200,0)   which gives $82,894.07.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Now you will stop making payments and let the money sit and earn interest for 20 more years. With a spreadsheet we enter     =FV(0.10\/12, 12*20, 0, 82894.07)   which gives $607,453.85.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    The process is similar with the formulas. For the first step we have:     And for the second step we use the compound interest formula from .     Now for Scenario 2: Since we are not investing anything for the first 15 years there is nothing to calculate. This is a one-step problem. We will find the future value with the monthly payments of $200 for 20 years. With a spreadsheet we enter     =FV(0.10\/12, 12*20, 200,0)   which gives $151,873.77.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To check that with the formula we have:     Were you surprised by these numbers? You would put in less money in scenario 1 and end up with four times as much. The key to compounding interest is to start early. If you remember the graph of compound interest in , we can see that as time goes on, the balance increases exponentially.      Deriving the Savings Plan Formula (Optional)  If you are interested in where the savings plan formula came from, we will explain it here. A savings plan with regular payments can be described recursively. Recall that basic compound interest follows from the relationship for each compound period.     For a savings plan, we need to add a deposit, d, to the account with each compounding period:     Taking this equation from recursive form to explicit form is a bit trickier than with compound interest. It will be easiest to see by working with an example rather than working in general.  Suppose we will deposit $100 each month into an account paying 6% APR. We assume that the account is compounded with the same frequency as we make deposits unless stated otherwise.  In this example:   , 6% APR   , 12 compounds\/deposits per year   , our deposit per month  Writing out the recursive equation gives where A is exchanged with where m is the number of compounding periods.     Assuming we start with an empty account, we can begin using this relationship:              Continuing this pattern, after m deposits, we'd have saved:     In other words, after months, the first deposit will have earned compound interest for months. The second deposit will have earned interest for months. Last month's deposit would have earned only one month worth of interest. The most recent deposit will have earned no interest yet.  This equation leaves a lot to be desired, though – it doesn't make calculating the ending balance any easier! To simplify things, multiply both sides of the equation by 1.005:     Distributing on the right side of the equation gives     Now we'll line this up with like terms from our original equation, and subtract each side        Almost all the terms cancel on the right side when we subtract, leaving     Solving for         Replacing with (Future Value), months with , where is measured in years, gives     Recall was and 100 was the deposit . The value 12 as , the number of deposits each year. Generalizing this result, we get the savings plan formula solved for . The second formula uses algebra to rearrange the formula to be solved for .

  "body": "  A traditional individual retirement account (IRA) is a special type of retirement account in which the money you invest is exempt from income taxes until you withdraw it. If you deposit $100 each month into an IRA earning 6% APR, how much will you have in the account after 20 years? How much will you have earned in interest? What percentage of the balance is interest?    To use a spreadsheet, we will use =FV because we want to know the balance in the future. We enter 100 for the payment amount and 0 for the present value:     =FV(0.06\/12, 12*20, 100, 0)   which gives a result of $46,204.09.

For our purposes we will ignore the signs.

The account will grow to $46,204.09 after 20 years.  To find the amount of interest earned , calculate the total of all your deposits.     The difference between the total amount and the deposits is the interest earned.     The total amount of interest you earned was $22,204.09.  To find the percentage of the balance that is interest we will divide the interest by the total balance.     or 48.1%. After 20 years 48.1% of the balance is from interest.   "

After 15 years, you leave the money, without making additional deposits, in the account for another 20 years. How much will you have in the end?  Scenario 2: Suppose instead you didn't invest anything for the first 15 years, then deposited $200 a month for 20 years into an account earning 10% APR compounded monthly. How much will you have in the end?    Before we calculate the balance for both scenarios, which one do you think will have a higher balance at the end?  For scenario 1, there are two steps involved. The first part is the monthly payments for 15 years. To calculate this with a spreadsheet we enter     =FV(0.10\/12, 12*15, 200,0)   which gives $82,894.07.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    Now you will stop making payments and let the money sit and earn interest for 20 more years.

The process is similar with the formulas. For the first step we have:     And for the second step we use the compound interest formula from .     Now for Scenario 2: Since we are not investing anything for the first 15 years there is nothing to calculate. This is a one-step problem. We will find the future value with the monthly payments of $200 for 20 years. With a spreadsheet we enter     =FV(0.10\/12, 12*20, 200,0)   which gives $151,873.77.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To check that with the formula we have:     Were you surprised by these numbers? You would put in less money in scenario 1 and end up with four times as much. The key to compounding interest is to start early. If you remember the graph of compound interest in , we can see that as time goes on, the balance increases exponentially.   "

  "title": "Loan Payments",
  "body": " Loan Payments   Loan Payments   Students will be able to:     Use a spreadsheet and\/or formula to calculate the payment amount for student loans, car loans, paying off credit cards and mortgage loans    Calculate the total paid over the life of a loan, amount of interest paid, and the percentage of the total amount paid in interest    Determine when to use each formula in the financial math chapter      In the last section, you learned about savings plans. In this section, you will learn about conventional loans (also called amortized loans or installment loans). Examples include student loans, car loans and home mortgages. These techniques do not apply to payday loans, add-on loans, or other loan types where the interest is calculated up front. In this section we will also briefly cover credit cards. There is a more thorough chapter on credit cards available as an optional chapter.   Alternative Video Lessons      Installment Loans  Installment loans are also called amortized loans . They are designed so that the payment amount remains the same over the life (term) of the loan. In order for that amount to remain constant, the amount of money going towards paying the principal (amount owed) and towards the interest will vary. At the beginning of the loan, the amount owed is the largest. So, at the beginning the amount of interest charged will also be the largest. As the loan gets repaid the amount owed is reduced and therefore the interest is reduced. Therefore, at the beginning of an installment loan payments go mostly towards the interest, towards the end the payments are going mostly towards the principal.    A graph that shows how most of the payment goes to interest at the beginning of the loan and that decreases over time until the end of the loan when most of the payment goes toward the principal.    This is a graph of the interest and principal paid on a loan of $34,000 at 10% APR. Each year $5391.72 was paid in total. In the first year, $3,3305.92 was applied to the interest and $2085.80 was applied to the principal. In the last year of the loan, only $281.04 was applied to the interest and $5,110.68 was applied to the principal. Over 5 years, a total of $53,917.2 was paid for a loan of $34,000.    Loan Formulas  In a savings plan, you start with nothing, put money into an account once or on a regular basis, and have a larger balance at the end. Loans work in reverse. You start with a balance owed, make payments and the future value is zero when the loan is paid off.  We will continue to use the same spreadsheet formulas. The ones that are most useful for loans are =PV and =PMT . We will look at how the inputs change for a loan.   Spreadsheet Formulas   =PV(rate per period, number of periods, payment amount, future value)    =PMT(rate per period, number of periods, present value, future value)      rate per period  is the interest rate per compounding period,     number of periods  is the total number of periods,     payment amount  is the amount of regular payments,     present value  is the amount deposited or principal,     future value  is the amount you want in the future, 0 for a loan      These two formulas correspond to the formulas below. The formula for loans is derived in a similar way that we did for savings plans, but notice they have negative exponents. The details are omitted here.   Loan Formulas         is the balance in the account at the beginning (the principal, or amount of the loan).     is your loan payment (your monthly payment, annual payment, etc.)     is the annual interest rate in decimal form     is the number of compounding periods in one year     is the length of the loan, in years     Like before, the compounding frequency is not always explicitly given, but is determined by how often you make payments    Teresa wants to buy a car that costs $15,000. She has $3,000 saved for the car and plans to finance the rest. She found a 3-year loan at 2.75% APR and a 5-year loan at 4% APR. How much will her monthly car payment be for each loan and how do these loans compare to each other.  To use a spreadsheet, we use the =PMT formula. For a loan, the loan amount is the present value and the future value is 0, indicating that the loan will be paid off. Teresa is making a down payment, so we also need to subtract that from the cost of the car to find the loan amount:     Her loan amount is $12,000. For the 3-year loan at 2.75% APR, we enter:     =PMT(0.0275\/12, 12*3, 12000, 0)   and get a result of $347.65.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    For the formula, we use the one solved for :   , for 2.75% annual rate   , monthly payments   , for 3 years   , since she can pay $3,000 of the $15,000     Teresa's car payment would be $347.65.  Now for the 5-year loan at 4% APR, we enter:     =PMT(0.04\/12, 12*5, 12000, 0)   and we get $221.00.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To use the formula, we have:   , for 4% annual rate   , monthly payments   , for 5 years   , the loan amount     Now let's compare the loans by finding out how much Teresa would pay in interest for each loan.    For the 3-year loan at 2.75% APR, her payments would total:   . Her interest would be $515.40.    For the 5-year loan at 4% APR, her payments would total:   . Her interest would be $1,260.00.    There are two main differences between these two loans: the monthly payments and the total paid over the life of the loans. The first loan has a higher monthly payment by $126.65 per month. However, she would pay $744.60 less in interest.   In addition to loan payments, we can calculate the amount of loan we can afford given a monthly payment. Let's look at that in the next example.    You can afford $200 per month as a car payment. If you can get an auto loan at 3% APR for 60 months (5 years), how expensive of a car can you afford? In other words, what amount loan can you pay off with $200 per month?    To use a spreadsheet for this problem, we use the =PV formula because we want to know the present value, which is the value of the loan right now. We enter    =PV(0.03\/12, 12*5, 200,0) which gives $11,130.47.   An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To use a formula, we are looking for , the starting amount of the loan.   , the monthly loan payment   , 3% annual rate   , since we're doing monthly payments, we'll compound monthly   , since we're making monthly payments for 5 years     You can afford a maximum loan of $11,130.47. If you have a down payment you can add that to get the value of the car you can buy. If there are any closing costs for the loan you also need to take that into consideration.  To find the amount of interest you will pay for this loan, calculate the total of all your payments.     Then take the difference between the total payments and the loan amount.     In this case, you would be paying $869.53 in interest.    So far, we have looked at car loans. Student loans and home mortgages are calculated in the same way. Here is an example of a mortgage payment.    You want to take out a $140,000 mortgage (home loan). The interest rate on the loan is 6%, and the loan is for 30 years. How much will your monthly payments be? What percentage of your total payments will go towards interest?    To use a spreadsheet for this problem, we use the =PMT formula because we want to know the payment amount. The amount of the loan is the present value and to pay off the loan the future value is 0. We enter    =PMT(0.06\/12, 12*30, 140000,0) which gives us $839.37.   An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To use the formula, we have:   , 6% annual rate   , since we're paying monthly   , 30 years   , the starting loan amount  In this case, we're going to use the equation that is solved for .     You would make payments of $839.37 per month for 30 years. To find out what percentage of the total will go towards interest, we need to total up all of the payments.     Then take the difference between the total payments and the loan amount.     In this case, you would be paying $162,173.20 in interest over the life of the loan. To find the percentage, we divide the interest by the total amount paid.     About 53.7% of the total is being paid towards interest.      Remaining Loan Balance  With loans, it is often desirable to determine what the remaining loan balance will be after some number of years. For example, if you purchase a home and plan to sell it in five years, you might want to know how much of the loan balance you will have paid off and how much you will have to pay from the sale.  To determine the remaining loan balance after some number of years, we first need to calculate the payment amount, if we don't already know it. Remember that only a portion of your loan payments go towards the loan balance; a portion is going to go towards interest. For example, if your payments were $1,000 a month, after a year you will not have paid off $12,000 of the loan balance.  To determine the remaining loan balance, we can think how much loan will these loan payments be able to pay off in the remaining time on the loan?     If a 30-year mortgage at an interest rate of 6% APR has payments of $1,000 a month, what will the loan balance be in 5 years?    To determine this, we need to think backwards. We are looking for the amount of the loan that can be paid off by $1,000 per month in the remaining 25 years. In other words, we're looking for when:   , for the monthly loan payment   , for 6% annual rate   , since we're doing monthly payments, we'll compound monthly   , since we'd be making monthly payments for 25 more years  To use a spreadsheet for this problem, we use the =PV formula because we want to know what the present value would be at the time you want to sell in 5 years. We enter:    =PV(0.06\/12, 12*25, 1000,0) which gives us $155,206.86.   An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To check this with the formula we have:     The loan balance with 25 years remaining on the loan will be $155,206.86    Sometimes answering remaining balance questions requires two steps, both of which we have done in this section:   Calculate the monthly payment on the loan    Calculate the remaining loan balance based on the remaining time on the loan       Credit Cards  Credit cards are useful to many people. They can be used to build a credit score, as a short-term loan and as an alternative to physical cash. It is highly advisable to fully pay off a credit card each month because the interest rates are much higher than the conventional installment loans we discussed earlier. There can also be many expensive fees applied when carrying a balance. Because of these higher rates, it can be very easy to get into a lot of debt quickly.  Credit cards are a common source of loan money, and therefore a common source of debt which must be repaid. There are much fewer and lower barriers to obtaining and using a credit card than there are to obtaining, for example, a mortgage. As such, there are some drawbacks both in terms of typically higher interest rates, as well as some structural differences.    Bilqis gets a credit card, with 17.99% APR compounding daily. She uses the card to buy a $900 plane ticket. She does not make any payments during the interest-free grace period. Her first payment is due 35 days after the grace period ended. Following the fine print in the credit card agreement, the minimum payment is calculated to be 1% of the outstanding balance after applying the APR; or $25, whichever is larger. What is her outstanding balance? What is her minimum payment? If she pays the minimum payment what will her new balance be?    First we will see what she owes with the 17.99% APR using the compound interest formula for 35 days:     The spreadsheet formula for this computation is =FV(0.1799\/365,35,0,900)   With interest, Bilqis now owes $915.66.  Now we will find one percent of the new balance which is .  $25 is larger than $9.16, so her first payment must be at least $25. If she makes the minimum payment we can subtract to find her new balance:   .  Her new balance will be $890.66.

What will your monthly payments be?    , which gives   or =PMT(2%\/12,48,25000)     You decide to finance a $12,000 car at 3% APR compounded monthly for 4 years. What will your monthly payments be? How much interest will you pay over the life of the loan?    , which gives   or =PMT(3%\/12,48,12000)   The interest will be the total amount paid, minus the amount of the loan. So the interest here is     You want to buy a $200,000 home. You plan to pay 10% as a down payment and take out a 30-year loan for the rest.     How much is the loan amount going to be?

First, we need to find out the amount of the monthly payments for this loan.   , which gives   or =PMT(3%\/12,12*5,24000)   The amount still owed three years later, is the present value of the two years of remaining payments on the loan.   , which gives   or =PV(3%\/12,12*2,-431.25)     A friend bought a house 15 years ago, taking out a $120,000 mortgage at 6% APR for 30 years. How much does she still owe on the mortgage?   First, we need to find out the amount of the monthly payments for this loan.   , which gives   or =PMT(6%\/12,12*30,120000)   The amount still owed fifteen years later, is the present value of the fifteen years of remaining payments on the loan.   , which gives   or =PV(6%\/12,12*15,-719.46)      Use a spreadsheet (not formulas) to answer problems 9 through 13 below.    Imagine you have $20,000 saved as a down payment on a house. You wish to take out a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage loan at 4% APR (remember that mortgage rates usually assume monthly compounding). If the maximum mortgage payment you can afford is $950 per month, then what is the maximum house price that you can afford?    =PV(4%\/12,12*30,950) which gives $198,988.18.  Now add $20,000 to this balance, which gives $218,988.18.    Suppose another mortgage lender offers you a fixed-rate 15-year mortgage at 2.95% APR. You have $20,000 saved as a down payment, and you can afford a maximum mortgage payment of $950 per month. You are interested in a certain house for sale, with firm selling price of $200,000.     Find the monthly payment for this house. Can you afford it, under the terms of this lender?    (Challenge): Suppose this same lender offers to increase the APR by only 0.05%, for each additional year added to the loan period beyond 15 years (so that a 16-year loan would have 3.00% APR, and a 17-year loan would have 3.05% APR, and so on), up to a maximum loan period of 25 years. Given these terms, does any combination of APR and loan period exist that would let you afford the house? If so, state the minimum number of additional years needed, the total resulting loan period, the resulting APR, and the resulting monthly payment.          =PMT(2.95%\/12,12*15,180000,0) which gives $1,238.72.  You cannot afford this home.    Using trial-and-error: The minimum number of additional years is 8. There is a 23 year loan period, 3.35% APR, and $936.24 monthly payment.       An annuity firm pays 5% APR compounded yearly, and offers an investor the following: Deposit $100,000 with them today, and then starting one year from today, you will receive ten equal annual payments, with zero balance remaining afterward in the account. If an investor accepts their offer, then find the following:     What will be the payment amount for each of the ten equal payments?    After ten years, how much interest will the investor have received, and what percentage of the total payment sum will represent interest?          =PMT(5%,10,100000,0) which gives $12,950.46.    The total payments will be $129,504.60.  The interest is the amount over the $100,000 initial investment, or $29,504.60.  The percentage of the total payment sum representing interest will be , or approximately 22.7827%.       For twelve full years, and into an account that pays 3.5% APR compounded quarterly: Yanhong will either pay $1500 at the end of each calendar quarter, or, deposit a single lump sum that will give the same future value amount.     If Yanhong chooses the single lump sum option, then how much will Yanhong need to deposit?    If Yanhong needs to have earned $100,000 in this account at the end of the twelve years, then the quarterly deposit amount will need to be increased. What would the new quarterly deposit amount need to be?    (Challenge): If Yanhong will make quarterly deposits into this account for the twelve years, but also has $8,000 to additionally deposit into this account right away: What would the new quarterly deposit amount need to be, so that the total balance after twelve years is $100,000?          =PV(3.5%\/4,4*12,1500) which gives $58,586.02.     =PMT(3.5%\/4,4*12,0,100000) which gives $1,685.34.     =PMT(3.5%\/4,4*12,-8000,100000) which gives $1,480.51.  (Note 8000 is input as negative, to signify a payment.)  Note this answer can also be found by subtracting the future value of $8000 here, which equals $12,153.47, from the required ending balance of $100,000 (which leaves $87,846.47) and then using the PMT function:   =PMT(3.5%\/4,4*12,0,100000-12153.47) which again gives $1,480.51.  This can also be done in nested fashion (be careful to add the negative FV quantity): =PMT(3.5%\/4,4*12,0,100000+FV(3.5%\/4,4*12,0,8000)) .       Assume you take out a 30-year mortgage loan for $250,000 at a fixed 4.5% APR.     What will be the amount of your monthly payment?    After the first ten years of payments, how much will remain on your loan balance?    After the first twenty years of payments, how much will remain on your loan balance?    Notice that the amount of the loan balance reduction during the second ten years, was very considerably bigger than the amount of the loan balance reduction during the first ten years. Why does the loan balance decrease at a faster and faster pace, the longer that the loan has been in repayment?          =PMT(4.5%\/12,12*30,250000) which gives $1,266.71.    This will be the present value of the remaining 240 loan payments:   =PV(4.5%\/12,12*20,1266.71) which gives $200,223.07.    This will be the present value of the remaining 120 loan payments:   =PV(4.5%\/12,12*10,1266.71) which gives $122,223.99.    At the beginning of the repayment period, most of each payment goes to interest (thus the loan balance reduces very slowly at first). Over time, more of each payment shifts to principal, and less to interest. At the end of the loan repayment period, nearly all the payment is going to principal.         For each of the following scenarios, determine which formula from sections 2.2-2.4 to use and solve the problem.    Keisha received an inheritance of $20,000 and invested it at 6.9% APR, compounded continuously. How much will she have for college in 8 years?    =20000*EXP(0.069*8) = $34,734.46. Keisha will have $34,734.46 in 8 years.    Paul wants to buy a new car. Rather than take out a loan, he decides to save $200 a month in an account earning 3.5% APR compounded monthly. How much will he have saved up after 3 years?    =FV(0.035\/12,3*12,200,0) = $7,579.95. Paul will have $7,579.95 in 3 years.    Sol is managing investments for a non-profit company. They want to invest some money in an account earning 5% APR compounded annually with the goal to have $30,000 in the account in 6 years. How much should Sol deposit into the account?    =PV(0.05\/1,6*1,0,30000) = $22,386.46. Sol should deposit $22,386.46 to have $30,000 in 6 years.    Miao is going to finance new office equipment at 2.8% APR over a 4-year term. If she can afford monthly payments of $100, how much equipment can she buy?    =PV(0.028\/12,4*12,100,0) = $4,535.96. Miao can finance $4,535.96 in equipment to have a monthly loan payment of $100 for 4 years.    How much would you need to save every month in an account earning 4.1% APR to have $5,000 saved up in two years.    =PMT(0.041\/12,2*12,0,5000) = $200.26. You would need to save $200.26 every month to have $5,000 in 2 years.    Terry and Jess are buying a house for $405,000 and they can afford to put 10% down. Their interest rate is 4.3% APR for 30 years. What will their monthly mortgage payment be?    =PMT(0.043\/12,30*12,364500,0) = $1,803.81. Their mortgage payment would be $1,803.81.    You loan your sister $500 for two years and she agrees to pay you back with 3% simple interest per year. How much will she pay you back    =500+500*.03*2 = $530. Your sister should pay you back $530 in 2 years.    Zahid starts saving $150 per month in an account that pays 4.8% APR compounded monthly. If he continues for 20 years, how much will he have? If he waited 10 years instead and put in $300 per month for 10 years with the same interest, how much would he have?   For the first plan: =FV(0.048\/12,20*12,150,0) = $60,251.26. Zahid would have $60,251.26 if he puts in $150 per month for 20 years.  For the second plan: =FV(0.048\/12,10*12,300,0) = $46,089.59. Zahid would only have $46,089.59 if he waited and put in $300 per month for 10 years.     "

  "body": " Teresa wants to buy a car that costs $15,000. She has $3,000 saved for the car and plans to finance the rest. She found a 3-year loan at 2.75% APR and a 5-year loan at 4% APR. How much will her monthly car payment be for each loan and how do these loans compare to each other.  To use a spreadsheet, we use the =PMT formula. For a loan, the loan amount is the present value and the future value is 0, indicating that the loan will be paid off. Teresa is making a down payment, so we also need to subtract that from the cost of the car to find the loan amount:     Her loan amount is $12,000. For the 3-year loan at 2.75% APR, we enter:     =PMT(0.0275\/12, 12*3, 12000, 0)   and get a result of $347.65.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.

Now for the 5-year loan at 4% APR, we enter:     =PMT(0.04\/12, 12*5, 12000, 0)   and we get $221.00.    An image of the spreadsheet showing the formula used and the result.    To use the formula, we have:   , for 4% annual rate   , monthly payments   , for 5 years   , the loan amount     Now let's compare the loans by finding out how much Teresa would pay in interest for each loan.    For the 3-year loan at 2.75% APR, her payments would total:   . Her interest would be $515.40.    For the 5-year loan at 4% APR, her payments would total:   . Her interest would be $1,260.00.    There are two main differences between these two loans: the monthly payments and the total paid over the life of the loans. The first loan has a higher monthly payment by $126.65 per month. However, she would pay $744.60 less in interest.  "

Prior to this, taxes were primarily collected through tariffs on imported goods, poll taxes, and property taxes. A poll tax , also referred to as a head tax, was a fixed amount every liable individual had to pay. Payment of the poll tax was often required before a person could register to vote or be issued a hunting or fishing license.  Tax policy in the United States is a politically divisive issue. In general, Democrats seek to lower taxes for low and middle income earners and raise taxes for the wealthy, while Republicans support a variety of tax cuts and limiting the amount wealthy earners are taxed. There is even debate as to the current length of the tax code! Some claim that the code is over 70,000 pages while others insist it is just over 2,000. Nevertheless, there is at least one thing everyone can agree with - you don't want to be on the wrong side of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)!    Types of Income Tax   Income tax is a tax that is levied on earned income or profit. Income taxes are collected by the federal government, states, and even some municipalities. Income taxes are an important source of funding, and are used to finance social programs, maintain and expand infrastructure, and provide foreign aid, among other things.    Federal Income Tax  Anyone who earns income over a certain amount (approximately $10,000 for an individual) must file a federal tax return and have taxes collected on their behalf. The amount of federal tax owed is determined by your filing status and taxable income .    State Income Tax  Forty-one states and the District of Columbia collect taxes on income from wages and investment. Seven states - Washington, Nevada, South Dakota, Wyoming, Alaska, Texas, and Florida – do not collect tax on wage or investment income, and two states – New Hampshire and Tennessee – only collect tax on investment income. The amount of tax collected varies by state, with each state averaging between $500 and $3000 per person.    Municipal Income Tax  Some municipalities (urban districts) also collect income taxes. For example, business owners in Multnomah County pay a municipal tax on their business income, and workers in the Tri-met district (area served by Tri-met) have their wages taxed at 0.7537%.    Calculating Federal Income Tax  Not all income is taxed, and not all income that gets taxed is taxed at the same rate. The general process of calculating the amount of federal income tax you owe is outlined in the chart below.   Steps to Calculate Federal Income Tax   Five rectangles showing the steps: 1. Calculate gross income by adding all income; 2. Calculate adjusted gross income (AGI) by subtracting any pre-tax adjustments; 3. Calculate taxable income by subtracting deductions (itemized or standard); 4. Calculate tax using tax table for your filing status; 5. Calculate refund or amount owed by subtracting credits and withholdings. If the amount is negative you get a refund; if the amount is positive you owe money.      Gross Income   Gross income includes all wages, tips, earned interest, dividends, rents and royalties, alimony, property gains, income tax refunds, etc. Keep in mind that ALL income means ALL income. Even income earned from a crime must be reported!    Adjusted Gross Income   Adjustments are eligible expenses used to reduce your gross income. Adjustments are tax-exempt and thus reduce the amount owed in taxes. Eligible expenses include contributions to tax deferred savings plans (401k, Individual Retirement Plan (IRA)), school tuition, student loan interest, moving expenses, business expenses, flexible spending accounts and health savings account contributions.    Taxable Income   Taxable income is determined by subtracting your deductions from your adjusted gross income. You may choose to take either a standard deduction , which is determined by your filing status, or you may choose to itemize your deductions. Itemized deductions may include state and local income taxes, property taxes, medical expenses, mortgage interest, and charitable donations.  Prior to the 2018 tax year, you could also claim personal exemptions . Exemptions of $4,050 for each member of the household were subtracted from the adjusted gross income along with either the standard or itemized deduction to determine taxable income. Starting in 2018, however, the standard deduction was doubled, and personal exemptions were eliminated.  Let's look at an example of how to calculate gross income and adjusted gross income (AGI).   Sasha received $45,000 in wages and earned $1,300 in interest from his savings plan. He paid $1,400 in student loan interest, and put $4,000 into his Individual Retirement Account (IRA). Determine Sasha's adjusted gross income.  To calculate Sasha's adjusted gross income, we need to first determine his gross income. His gross income includes his wages and earned interest:  Gross Income   To find his adjusted gross income, we need to subtract eligible adjustments from his gross income. His eligible adjustments include the interest paid on his student loans, and his contributions to his IRA:  Adjusted Gross Income      Filing Status  Your filing status is determined by your family situation. Are you married, widowed, divorced, caring for a family member? It is possible to fall into more than one category, but you may choose the one that is most beneficial for you.    Single: If you are unmarried, legally separated from your spouse, or divorced on the last day of the year.     Married Filing Jointly: If you are married and both you and your spouse agree to file a joint return. (On a joint return, you report your combined income and deduct your combined allowable expenses.)     Married Filing Separately: If you are married and you want to be responsible only for your own tax, or if this status results in less tax than a joint return.     Head of Household (with qualifying person): If you are 1) unmarried or considered unmarried on the last day of the year, 2) paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year, and 3) have a qualifying dependent living with you for more than half the year (except temporary absences, such as school).     Qualifying Widow\/Widower (with dependent child): This status is available for the two years following the death of your spouse.     Your filing status determines your standard deduction and tax liability. The standard deduction for each filing status for the tax year 2024 is given in the table below.     Filing Status  Standard Deduction for Tax Year 2024    Single  $14600    Married Filing Jointly  $29200    Married Filing Separately  $14600    Head of Household  $21900    Qualifying Widow  $29200     Here is an example where we calculate adjusted gross income and taxable income.    Maria earned wages of $32,400 from her job as a server. She also earned $8,300 in tips, and received $95 in interest from a savings account. In trying to save for retirement, Maria has put $3,500 into a 401K tax deferred savings plan. She is unmarried and lives with her six year old daughter. Determine Maria's gross income, adjusted gross income, and taxable income.    Maria's gross income includes her wages, tips, and earned interest.  Gross Income = $32,400 + $8,300 + $95 = $40,795  Maria can use her 401k contribution as an adjustment.  Adjusted Gross Income = $40,795 - $3,500 = $37,295  Since Maria is unmarried and is the primary caregiver for her daughter, she can file as the head of household and take the standard deduction of $18,000.  Taxable Income = $37,295 - $18,000 = $19,295      Tax Tables  The United States has a progressive federal income tax system which means the more income you have, the more you generally pay in taxes. There are marginal tax rates that go up according to our income, but we don't pay the same rate on all of our income. The ranges of income are called tax brackets and the buckets in the illustration below can help us visualize the brackets.  The cutoff values in the figure are for a married couple filing jointly, but the percentages are the same for everyone as you'll see in the table on the next page. We pay 10% of any taxable income in the first bucket. If the first bucket is full, we move to the second bucket and we pay 12% of that income. This couple is in the 22% tax bracket because the 3rd bucket is partially filled. They will pay 22% of the income in that bucket, but they are not paying 22% of their entire income.   Tax Buckets by John Chesbrough, licensed under CC-BY-ND-NC 4.0 .   A drawing that shows the tax brackets as buckets being filled from a hose labeled taxable income; the first bucket for the 10% tax bracket is full and has the range of $0-19,050; the second bucket for the 12% tax bracket is also full and has the range of $19051-77,400; the third bucket for the 22% bracket is partially full and has the range of $77,401-165,000; there are buckets for the 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% tax brackets which are empty. The cutoff values for all of these brackets are given in the next table.    Here is a table with cutoff values for each filing status. Everyone pays a tax of 10% on any income in the first tax bracket. Then we all pay 12% of the next bracket of income, 22% of the next bracket, and so on. This keeps going up to the 37% tax bracket.    2024 Tax Year Marginal Tax Rates    Marginal Tax Rate On Taxable Income  Filing Single  Filing as Head of Household  Married filing Jointly  Married filing Separately    10%  First $11,600  First $16,550  First $23,200  First $11,600    12%  $11,600 – $47,150  $16,550 – $63,100  $23,200 – $94,300  $11,600 – $47,150    22%  $47,150 – $100,525  $63,100 – $100,500  $94,300 – $201,050  $47,150 – $100,525    24%  $100,525 – $191,950  $100,500 – $191,950  $201,050 – $383,900  $100,525 – $191,950    32%  $191,950 – $243,725  $191,950 – $243,700  $383,900 – $487,450  $191,950 – $243,725    35%  $243,725 – $609,350  $243,700 – $609,350  $487,450 – $731,200  $243,725 – $365,600    37%  Over $609,350  Over $609,350  Over $731,200  Over $365,600      Let's see how to use this table to calculate taxes in an example.    If Avery is filing single and has $55,100 in taxable income, calculate their tax.    We begin with the lowest tax bracket and take 10% of $11,600. Since their income is higher than that, we add 12% of the next amount, found by subtracting the values in that bracket. Avery's taxable income is in the 22% tax bracket, so we find the amount over $38,700 by subtracting. Here is the full calculation:      Avery would owe $7,175 in taxes. Note that their overall tax rate is somewhere between 10% and 22%. We can calculate the actual rate by dividing their tax owed by their taxable income:   or about 13%    We could calculate all taxes this way, but you might notice that the first few terms will be the same if the buckets are full. For this reason, we can simplify these tax tables. The tax tables below give the value for all of the lower tax buckets that are full. There is a tax table for each filing status and the cutoffs are regularly adjusted for inflation, so they usually vary from year to year.  The next four tables give the tax calculations for 2024 federal income taxes by filing status.    Filing as Single (Tax Year 2024)    If taxable income is:  The tax is:    Not over $11,600  10% of the taxable income    Over $11,600 but not over $47,150  $1,160 plus 12% of the excess over $11,600    Over $47,150 but not over $100,525  $5,426 plus 22% of the excess over $47,150    Over $100,525 but not over $191,950  $17,168.50 plus 24% of the excess over $100,525    Over $191,950 but not over $243,725  $39,110.50 plus 32% of the excess over $191,950    Over $243,725 but not over $609,350  $55,678.50 plus 35% of the excess over $243,725    Over $609,350  $183,647.25 plus 37% of the excess over $609,350        Filing as Head of Household (Tax Year 2024)    If taxable income is:  The tax is:    Not over $16,650  10% of the taxable income    Over $16,650 but not over $63,100  $1,665 plus 12% of the excess over $16,650    Over $63,100 but not over $100,500  $7,241 plus 22% of the excess over $63,100    Over $100,500 but not over $191,950  $15,469 plus 24% of the excess over $100,500    Over $191,950 but not over $243,700  $37,417 plus 32% of the excess over $191,950    Over $243,700 but not over $609,350  $53,977 plus 35% of the excess over $243,700    Over $609,350  $181,954.50 plus 37% of the excess over $609,350        Married Filing Jointly (Tax Year 2024)    If taxable income is:  The tax is:    Not over $23,200  10% of the taxable income    Over $23,200 but not over $94,300  $2,320 plus 12% of the excess over $23,200    Over $94,300 but not over $201,050  $10,852 plus 22% of the excess over $94,300    Over $201,050 but not over $383,900  $34,337 plus 24% of the excess over $201,050    Over $383,900 but not over $487,450  $78,221 plus 32% of the excess over $383,900    Over $487,450 but not over $731,200  $111,357 plus 35% of the excess over $487,450    Over $731,200  $196,669.50 plus 37% of the excess over $731,200        Married Filing Separately (Tax Year 2024)    If taxable income is:  The tax is:    Not over $11,600  10% of the taxable income    Over $11,600 but not over $47,150  $1,160 plus 12% of the excess over $11,600    Over $47,150 but not over $100,525  $5,426 plus 22% of the excess over $47,150    Over $100,525 but not over $191,950  $17,168.50 plus 24% of the excess over $100,525    Over $191,950 but not over $243,725  $39,110.50 plus 32% of the excess over $191,950    Over $243,725 but not over $365,600  $55,678.50 plus 35% of the excess over $243,725    Over $365,600  $98,334.75 plus 37% of the excess over $365,600        Suppose Adira is filing as head of household and has a taxable income of $106,450. Calculate her taxes using the individual tax brackets and with the simplified table.    We will calculate Adira's taxes first the long way:        Now, using the simplified tax table for single filing status, we see that Adira's taxable income puts her in the 24% tax bracket. The simplified table tells us that her taxes will be equal to $15,469 plus 24% of the excess over $100,500. Notice the number $15,469 is very close to what we got for all of the “full” tax brackets, so we only need to calculate the last one. To find the excess over $82,500, we subtract $82,500 from her taxable income. Thus, her taxes are:     We see that both methods result in the same value, $16,897, for Adira's taxes.      Phyllis and Gladys are married and filing jointly. Together their taxable income is $132,000. Use the simplified 2024 tax tables from this section to determine how much they owe in taxes.    Since Phyllis and Gladys are married and filing jointly, their taxable income puts them in the 22% tax bracket. Using the simplified 2024 tax table, their taxes are $10,852 plus 22% of the excess over $94,300:     Phyllis and Gladys owe $19,146 in taxes.      Tax Credits   Tax credits are different from deductions in that they reduce the amount of tax you owe by the full amount of the credit, not just a percentage. This makes credits much more valuable than deductions.  Common tax credits include child tax credits, earned income credits, child and dependent care credits, American opportunity tax credits, lifetime learning credits, and various federal energy credits.    Shiro is in the 22% tax bracket and itemizes his deductions. How much will his tax bill be reduced if he makes a $1,000 contribution to charity? How much will his bill be reduced if he gets a $1,000 tax credit?    The tax credit will reduce his tax bill by the full amount of the credit, so the $1,000 tax credit will reduce his tax bill by $1,000. As a deduction, however, his contribution to charity will only reduce his tax bill by 22% of the $1,000, or 0.22($1,000) = $220. Tax credits are always better than deductions.      Calculating a Refund or Payment Due  Employers are required to take out an estimated amount for taxes from each of our paychecks. These withholdings are taken out, so we don't all have huge tax bills at the end of the year, and so the government has the income it needs to run. When you file your taxes, you compare the amount of tax you actually owe, with the withholdings from your paycheck. If you had more withheld during the year than you owe, you will file for a refund. If your withholdings were less, though, you must pay the difference. Let's look at a couple of examples with tax credits and withholdings.    John's taxes are $4,342.50. He can claim an American opportunity tax credit of $2,300 and he had $4,135 withheld from his paychecks. Determine if John will owe money or get a refund.    The first step is to reduce John's taxes by the full amount of the tax credit.     Next we subtract the amount withheld from his paychecks by his employer. Since his withholdings are greater than the amount he owes after applying the tax credit, he will receive a refund equal to the difference.     John will receive a refund of $1,092.50. Notice that having a negative amount after subtracting credits and withholdings means you will receive a refund, while having a positive amount means you still owe money.      As we discovered in , Phyllis and Gladys owe $19,146 in taxes. Their employers withheld $9,905 and they received a $8,500 credit for their purchase of an electric car. Will they receive a refund, or will they need to make a payment?    To determine whether they will receive a refund or if they will still owe money, we will first subtract the full amount of the electric car credit.     We now subtract their withholdings:     Since the value is positive, Phyllis and Gladys still owe $741 in taxes.      Exercises   Which decreases your tax bill more, a credit or a deduction?   A credit decreases your bill more. It decreases your bill by the full amount of the credit. A deduction only decreases your tax bill by a percentage.    You are in the 12% tax bracket and get a credit of $500. How has the amount of taxes owed changed?   The amount of taxes owed is decreased by $500.    You are in the 12% tax bracket and get a deduction of $500. How has the amount of taxes owed changed?   The amount of taxes owed is decreased by $60 because 12% of $500 is $60.    Can you take the standard deduction and itemize your deductions?   No, you must choose to take either the standard deduction or itemized deductions.    Can you make adjustments to your income and take the standard deduction?   Yes, you can make adjustments and take a deduction. Adjustments to your income happen before deductions.    If you decide to take the standard deduction what have you considered?   If you decide to take the standard deduction you determine that itemizing would not save you more money.    Shaysiah has paid $13,500 in mortgage interest which she can take as a deduction and has $1,900 in other deductions that she can take this year. She is filing as single. Should she itemize her deductions or take the standard deduction?   Shaysiah should itemize because itemizing reduces her taxable income by $15,400. The standard deduction would have reduced her taxable income by $14,600.    If you are married do you have to file your taxes together?   You can either file as married filing jointly or married filing separately.    Fredrick is concerned about the effect of a raise on his taxes. He's getting a raise of $3,000, putting him into a higher tax bracket by $1,000 dollars. He's concerned about his entire income being taxed at 22% instead of 12%. Should he be concerned? Why or why not?   No, Fredrick should not be concerned. Only the $1000 will be taxed at 22%. The rest of his income will be taxed at a lower level.    A single person with taxable income of $95,000 will have the first $11,600 of that income taxed at what rate? Determine the taxes owed on just the first $11,600.   The first $11,600 will be taxed at 10% resulting in $1,160 owed in taxes.    A single person with taxable income of $185,000 will have the first $11,600 of that income taxed at a different rate than the income between $11,600 and $47,150. Determine the taxes owed on just the second bracket.   There is a total of $35,550 between $11,600 and $47,150. 12% of $35,550 is $4,266.    Using the simplified 2024 tax table, determine the income tax owed for a single person who has $90,000 of taxable income.   $90,000 falls into the third tax bracket. The first two brackets resulted in $5,426 and the third bracket has the excess over $47,150 being taxed at the higher rate of 22%. This results in a tax of $13,539.50.       Doug and Chris are filing jointly. They owe $16,589 in taxes. Throughout the year they had $13,456 withheld from their paychecks, and they can claim an energy credit of $2,500 for purchasing a hybrid vehicle. Determine the amount they will need to pay or will get refunded.   $16,589 in taxes minus $13,456 for withholdings, and they can claim and $2,500 in credits. This leaves them owing $633.    Heather owes $7,589 in taxes. Throughout the year she had $6,456 withheld from her paychecks and she can claim an education credit of $1,980. Determine the amount she will need to pay or will get refunded.   $7,589 in taxes minus $6,456 for withholdings and education credit of $1,980. This leaves her refunded $847.    Determine the amount of taxes owed or the refund that would result in this situation:     Filing Status: Married filing jointly    Gross Income: $135,000    Adjustments: $5,600    Itemized Deductions: $19,400    Credits: $15,000     What is their adjusted gross income (AGI)?    Should they itemize or take the standard deduction?    Use the simplified 2018 tax tables to determine their taxes.    What is their final tax refund or amount still owed?            Take the income minus the adjustments . Their adjusted gross income is $129,400.    They should take the standard deduction because itemizing saves them less.    Taxable income:   Taxes owed:   They owe $12,150 in taxes.     Take the taxes owed minus credits and withholdings. They will receive a refund for $2,850.       Francis and Edward are planning to get married and they want to determine whether there is an advantage or disadvantage to marrying before the end of the year and filing their taxes jointly. Use the information below to calculate the amount they would owe or receive if they each filed as single, and the amount they would owe or receive if they filed jointly as a married couple. Which is the better choice?     Filing Status: TBD    Francis' Gross Income: $45,000    Edward's Gross Income: $50,000    Francis' Adjustments: $8,000    Edward's Adjustments: $4,000    Francis' Withholdings: $3,000    Edward's Withholdings: $3,500    Francis' Credits: $4,000    Edward's Credits: $1,000      SINGLE CASE:   Francis: Taxable Income     Tax from Table:     Owed\/Refund:       Edward: Taxable Income     Tax from Table:     Owed\/Refund:      Altogether, they will get a refund.  MARRIED CASE:   Taxable income:     Tax from Table:     Owed\/Refund:      Same either way! No marriage penalty unless it takes away credits.    Janice is unmarried and has two kids. She earned $96,000 in wages last year, received $850 in interest from a savings account, and contributed $26,000 to a tax deferred savings account. Her itemized deductions are $22,600.     Determine Janice's gross income.    Determine Janice's adjusted gross income.    Should Janice take the standard deduction or itemize? Explain.    Determine Janice's taxable income.    If Janice has $4,000 in child tax credits and had $5,300 withheld for taxes from her wages, will Janice owe money, or will she receive a refund? Calculate the amount.         Gross Income:     Adjusted Gross Income:     She should take itemized deductions since they are greater than the standard deduction for head of household.    Taxable Income:     Tax from Table: . Owed\/Refund:   Janice will receive a refund for $3,843.       "

  "body": "  Suppose Adira is filing as head of household and has a taxable income of $106,450. Calculate her taxes using the individual tax brackets and with the simplified table.    We will calculate Adira's taxes first the long way:        Now, using the simplified tax table for single filing status, we see that Adira's taxable income puts her in the 24% tax bracket. The simplified table tells us that her taxes will be equal to $15,469 plus 24% of the excess over $100,500. Notice the number $15,469 is very close to what we got for all of the “full” tax brackets, so we only need to calculate the last one. To find the excess over $82,500, we subtract $82,500 from her taxable income. Thus, her taxes are:     We see that both methods result in the same value, $16,897, for Adira's taxes.   "

The first step is to reduce John's taxes by the full amount of the tax credit.     Next we subtract the amount withheld from his paychecks by his employer. Since his withholdings are greater than the amount he owes after applying the tax credit, he will receive a refund equal to the difference.     John will receive a refund of $1,092.50.

But if we cannot distinguish credible information from misleading information, then we are vulnerable to manipulation and making decisions that are not in our best interest. Statistics provides tools for us to evaluate information critically. In this sense, statistics is one of the most important things to know about.  Statistics are often presented to add credibility to an argument. To give some examples, here are some claims that we have heard on several occasions. (We are not saying that each one of these claims is true!)   4 out of 5 dentists recommend Dentyne.    Almost 85% of lung cancers in men and 45% in women are tobacco-related.    Condoms are effective 94% of the time.    People tend to be more persuasive when they look others directly in the eye and speak loudly and quickly.    Women make 75 cents to every dollar a man makes when they work the same job.    A surprising new study shows that eating egg whites can increase one's life span.    People predict that it is very unlikely there will ever be another baseball player with a batting average over 400.    There is an 80% chance that in a room full of 30 people that at least two people will share the same birthday.    79.48% of all statistics are made up on the spot.     All these claims are statistical in character. We suspect that some of them sound familiar; if not, you have probably heard other claims like them. Notice how diverse the examples are; they come from psychology, health, law, sports, business, etc. Data and data-interpretation show up in virtually every facet of contemporary life.  Many of these numbers do not represent careful statistical analysis. They can be misleading and push you into decisions that you might regret. This chapter will help you learn the skills to be a critical consumer of statistical claims.    Statistical Process  To give you an overview, here is a diagram of the steps taken in a poll or other statistical study, and the elements in each step that we will discuss in this chapter. We will use many examples to illustrate the whole process.    5 rectangles indicating the 5 steps of the statistical process; 1. Identify the group you want to study, which is the population; 2. Identify the quantity you want to know about the population, which is the parameter; 3. Gather data by taking an unbiased sample or performing an experiment; 4. Graph the data and calculate statistics; 5. Estimate the parameter that you wanted to know with the margin of error and confidence interval.      Population  Before we begin gathering any data to analyze, we need to identify the population we are studying. The population of a study is the group we want to know something about. The population could be people, auto parts or tomato plants.  If we want to know the amount of money spent on textbooks by a typical college student, our population might be all students at Portland Community College. Or it might be:   All community college students in the state of Oregon.    All students at public colleges and universities in the state of Oregon.    All students at all colleges and universities in the state of Oregon.    All students at all colleges and universities in the entire United States.    And so on.     The intended population is also called the target population , since if we design our study badly, the collected data might not actually be representative of the intended population.    A newspaper website contains a poll asking people their opinion on a recent news article. What is the population?    While the target (intended) population may have been all people, the real population of the survey is readers of the website.      Parameter  A parameter is the value (percentage, average, etc.) that we are interested in for the whole population. Since it is often too time-consuming, expensive and\/or impossible to get data for the entire population, the parameter is usually a theoretical quantity that we are trying to estimate. For example, the typical amount of money spent per year on textbooks by students at your college in a year is a parameter.    Sample  To estimate the parameter, we select a sample , which is a smaller subset of the entire population. It is very important that we choose a representative sample , one that matches the characteristics of the population, to have a good estimate. If we survey 100 students at your college, those students would be our sample. We will talk about how to choose a representative sample later in this section.    Statistic  To get our data , we would then ask each student in the sample how much they spent on textbooks and record the answers, or raw data . Then we could calculate the average, which is our statistic. A statistic is a value (percentage, average, etc.) calculated using data from a sample.    A researcher wants to know how the citizens of Portland feel about a voter initiative. To study this, they go downtown to the Pioneer Place Mall and survey 500 shoppers. Sixty percent indicate they are supportive of the initiative. Identify the population, parameter, sample and statistic.     Population : While the intended population of this survey is Portland citizens, the effective population is Pioneer Place Mall shoppers. There is no reason to assume that shoppers at this mall would be representative of all Portland citizens.   Parameter : The parameter is what we want to know about the population, the percentage of Portland citizens that support the initiative.   Sample : The sample is the subgroup of the population selected. The 500 shoppers questioned make up the sample, which, again, is probably not representative of the population.   Statistic : The statistic is calculated using the data from the sample. The percentage of people sampled who support the initiative is 60%.      Sampling  As we mentioned in a previous section, the first thing we should do before conducting a survey is to identify the population that we want to study. Suppose we are hired by a politician to determine the amount of support they have among the electorate should they decide to run for another term. What population should we study? Every person in the district? Eligible voters might be better, but what if they don't register? Registered voters may not vote. What about likely voters?   This is the criteria used in a lot of political polling, but it is sometimes difficult to define a likely voter.  Here is an example of the challenges of political polling.   In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:   Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.    Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.    The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.     But one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in that election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter registration and a lower turnout rate for elections) so the polling samples were subject to sampling bias : they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning candidate.   So, identifying the population can be a difficult job, but once we have identified the population, how do we choose a good sample? We want our statistic to estimate the parameter we are interested in, so we need to have a representative sample. Returning to our hypothetical job as a political pollster, we would not anticipate very accurate results if we drew all of our samples from customers at a Starbucks, or your list of TikTok followers. How do we get a sample that resembles our population?    Sampling Methods  One way to get a representative sample is to use randomness. We will look at three types of sampling that use randomness and one that does not.    Simple random sample (SRS)  A simple random sample , abbreviated SRS, is one in which every member of the population has an equal probability of being chosen.   If we could somehow identify all likely voters in the state, put each of their names on a piece of paper, toss the slips into a (very large) hat and draw 1000 slips out of the hat, we would have a simple random sample.   In practice, computers are better suited for this sort of endeavor. It is always possible, however, that even a random sample might end up not being totally representative of the population. If we repeatedly take samples of 1000 people from among the population of likely voters in the state of Oregon, some of these samples might tend to have a slightly higher percentage of Democrats (or Republicans) than the general population; some samples might include more older people and some samples might include more younger people; etc. This is called sampling variation . If there are certain groups that we want to make sure are represented, we might instead use a stratified sample.    Stratified sampling  In stratified sampling , a population is divided into a number of subgroups (or strata). Random samples are then taken from each subgroup. It is often desirable to make the sample sizes proportional to the size of each subgroup in the population.   Suppose that data from voter registrations in the state indicated that the electorate was comprised of 39% Democrats, 37% Republicans and 24% Independents. In a sample of 1000 people, they would then expect to get about 390 Democrats, 370 Republicans and 240 Independents. To accomplish this, they could randomly select 390 people from among those voters known to be Democrats, 370 from those known to be Republicans, and 240 from those with no party affiliation.   A way to remember stratified sampling is think about having a piece of layer cake. Each layer represents a stratum or subgroup, and a slice of the cake represents a sample of each layer.    Systematic sampling  In systematic sampling , every member of the population is selected to be in the sample. The starting position is often chosen at random.   To select a systematic sample, Portland Community College could use their database to select a random student from the first 100 student ID numbers. Then they would select every 100th student ID number after that. Systematic sampling is not as random as a simple random sample (if your ID number is right next to your friend's because you applied at the same time, you could not both end up in the same sample) but it can yield acceptable samples. This method can be useful for people waiting in lines, parts on a manufacturing line, or plants in a row.     Convenience sampling   Convenience sampling is when samples are chosen by selecting whomever is convenient. This is the worst type of sampling because it does not use randomness.   A pollster stands on a street corner and interviews the first 100 people who agree to speak to them. This is a convenience sample.     Statistical Bias  There is no way to correct for biased data, so it is very important to think through the entire study and data analysis before we start. We talked about sampling or selection bias , which is when the sample is not representative of the population. One example of this is voluntary response bias , which is bias introduced by only collecting data from those who volunteer to participate. This can lead to bias if the people who volunteer have different characteristics than the general population. Here is a summary of some additional sources of bias.    Types of bias   Sampling bias – when the sample is not representative of the population   Voluntary response bias – the sampling bias that often occurs when the sample is made up of volunteers   Self-interest study – bias that can occur when the researchers have an interest in the outcome   Response bias – when the responder gives inaccurate responses for any reason   Perceived lack of anonymity – when the responder fears giving an honest answer might negatively affect them   Loaded questions – when the question wording influences the responses   Non-response bias – when people refuse to participate in a study or drop out of an experiment, we can no longer be certain that our sample is representative of the population  Sources of bias may be conscious or unconscious. They may be innocent or as intentional as pressuring by a pollster. Here are some examples of the types of bias.      Consider a recent study which found that chewing gum may raise math grades in teenagers Reuters. . Retrieved 4\/27\/09 . This study was conducted by the Wrigley Science Institute, a branch of the Wrigley chewing gum company. This is an example of a self-interest study; one in which the researches have a vested interest in the outcome of the study. While this does not necessarily mean the study was biased, we should subject the study to extra scrutiny.    Consider online reviews of products and businesses. Customers tend to leave reviews if they are very satisfied or very dissatisfied. While you can look for overall patterns and get useful information, these reviews suffer from voluntary response bias and likely capture more extreme views than the general population.    A survey asks participants a question about their interactions with people of different ethnicities. This study could suffer from response bias. A respondent might give an untruthful answer to not be perceived as racist.    An employer puts out a survey asking their employees if they have a drug abuse problem and need treatment help. Here, answering truthfully might have serious consequences; responses might not be accurate if there is a perceived lack of anonymity and employees fear retribution.    A survey asks, “Do you support funding research on alternative energy sources to reduce our reliance on high-polluting fossil fuels?” This is an example of a loaded or leading question – questions whose wording leads the respondent towards a certain answer.    A poll was conducted by phone with the question, “Do you often have time to relax and read a book?” Fifty percent of the people who were called refused to participate in the survey (Probably because they didn't have the time). It is unlikely that the results will be representative of the entire population. This is an example of non-response bias.      Loaded questions can occur intentionally by pollsters with an agenda, or accidentally through poor question wording. Also of concern is question order, where the order of questions changes the results. Here is an example from a psychology researcher Swartz, Norbert. Retrieved 3\/31\/2009 :    My favorite finding is this: we did a study where we asked students, 'How satisfied are you with your life? How often do you have a date?' The two answers were not statistically related - you would conclude that there is no relationship between dating frequency and life satisfaction. But when we reversed the order and asked, 'How often do you have a date? How satisfied are you with your life?' the statistical relationship was a strong one. You would now conclude that there is nothing as important in a student's life as dating frequency.      Observational Studies  So far, we have primarily discussed surveys and polls, which are types of observational studies – studies based on observations or measurements. These observations may be solicited, like in a survey or poll. Or, they may be unsolicited, such as studying the percentage of cars that turn right at a red light even when there is a no turn on red sign.    Experiments  In contrast, it is common to use experiments when exploring how subjects react to an outside influence. In an experiment, some kind of treatment is applied to the subjects and the results are measured and recorded. When conducting experiments, it is essential to isolate the treatment being tested. Here are some examples of treatments.      A pharmaceutical company tests a new medicine for treating Alzheimer's disease by administering the drug to 50 elderly patients with recent diagnoses. The treatment here is the new drug.    A gym tests out a new weight loss program by enlisting 30 volunteers to try out the program. The treatment here is the new program.    A psychology researcher explores the effect of music on affect by measuring people's mood while listening to different types of music. The music is the treatment.    Suppose a middle school finds that their students are not scoring well on the state's standardized math test. They decide to run an experiment to see if a new curriculum would improve scores. To run the test, they hire a math specialist to come in and teach a class using the new curriculum. To their delight, they see an improvement in test scores.  The difficulty with the last scenario is that it is not clear whether the new curriculum or the math specialist is responsible for the improvement. This is called confounding and it is the downfall of many experiments, though it is often hidden.        Confounding   Confounding occurs when there are two or more potential variables that could have caused the outcome and it is not possible to determine which one actually caused the result.      A drug company study about a weight loss pill might report that people lost an average of 8 pounds while using their new drug. However, in the fine print you find a statement saying that participants were encouraged to also diet and exercise. It is not clear in this case whether the weight loss is due to the pill, to diet and exercise, or a combination of both. In this case confounding has occurred.    Researchers conduct an experiment to determine whether students will perform better on an arithmetic test if they listen to music during the test. They first give the student a test without music, then give a similar test while the student listens to music. In this case, the student might perform better on the second test, regardless of the music, simply because it was the second test and they were warmed up.      There are a number of measures that can be introduced to help reduce the likelihood of confounding. The primary measure is to use a control group.    Control group  In experiments, the participants are typically divided into a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group receives the treatment being tested; the control group does not receive the treatment.  Ideally, the groups are otherwise as similar as possible, isolating the treatment as the only potential source of difference between the groups. For this reason, the method of dividing groups is important. Some researchers attempt to ensure that the groups have similar characteristics (same number of each gender identity, same number of people over 50, etc.), but it is nearly impossible to control for every characteristic. Because of this, random assignment is very commonly used.      To determine if a two-day prep course would help high school students improve their scores on the SAT test, a group of students was randomly divided into two subgroups. The first group, the treatment group, was given a two-day prep course. The second group, the control group, was not given the prep course. Afterwards, both groups took the SAT test.    A company testing a new plant food grows two crops of plants in adjacent fields that typically produce the same amount of food. The treatment group receives the new plant food and the control group does not. The crop yields would then be compared. By growing the two crops at the same time in similar fields, they are controlling for weather and other confounding factors.      Sometimes not giving the control group anything does not completely control for confounding variables. For example, suppose a medicine study is testing a new headache pill by giving the treatment group the pill and the control group nothing. If the treatment group showed improvement, we would not know whether it was due to the medicine, or a response to have something. This is called a placebo effect.    Placebo effect  The placebo effect is when the effectiveness of a treatment is influenced by the patient's perception of how effective they think the treatment will be, so a result might be seen even if the treatment is ineffectual.   A study found that when doing painful dental tooth extractions, patients told they were receiving a strong painkiller while actually receiving a saltwater injection found as much pain relief as patients receiving a dose of morphine. Levine JD, Gordon NC, Smith R, Fields HL. (1981) Analgesic responses to morphine and placebo in individuals with postoperative pain. Pain. 10:379-89.    To control for the placebo effect, a placebo , or dummy treatment, is often given to the control group. This way, both groups are truly identical except for the specific treatment given.    Placebo and Placebo-controlled experiments  An experiment that gives the control group a placebo is called a placebo-controlled experiment.      In a study for a new medicine that is dispensed in a pill form, a sugar pill could be used as a placebo.    In a study on the effect of alcohol on memory, a non-alcoholic beer might be given to the control group as a placebo.    In a study of a frozen meal diet plan, the treatment group would receive the diet food, and the control group could be given standard frozen meals taken out of their original packaging.      In some cases, it is more appropriate to compare to a conventional treatment than a placebo. For example, in a cancer research study, it would not be ethical to deny any treatment to the control group or to give a placebo treatment. In this case, the currently acceptable medicine would be given to the second group, called a comparison group . In our SAT test example, the non-treatment group would most likely be encouraged to study on their own, rather than be asked to not study at all, to provide a meaningful comparison. It is very important to consider the ethical ramifications of any experiment.    Blind studies  A blind study is one that uses a placebo and the participants do not know whether they are receiving the treatment or a placebo. A double-blind study is one in which the subjects and those interacting with them don't know who is in the treatment group and who is in the control group.   In a study about anti-depression medication, you would not want the psychological evaluator to know whether a patient is in the treatment or control group, as it might influence their evaluation. The experiment should be conducted as a double-blind study.     Margin of Error and Confidence Intervals  Even when a study or experiment has successfully avoided bias and has been well done, there is still an element of variation. If we took 5 different random samples of 100 college students and calculated their average textbook cost, we wouldn't expect to get the exact same average for each sample. This is due to sampling variation. To account for this, researchers publish their margin of error or a confidence interval for their statistics. These numbers describe the precision of the estimate for a certain confidence level.  You've probably heard something like, The candidate has 54 percent of the likely voters, plus or minus three percent. The 3% is called the margin of error , so the true percentage is somewhere between 51% and 57%, with a certain level of confidence. To write this as a confidence interval , we place the numbers in parentheses from smallest to largest, separated by a comma: (51%, 57%).  The most common confidence level is 95%, which means if the poll was conducted repeatedly, and we made a confidence interval each time, we would expect the true percentage, or parameter, to fall within our confidence interval 95 out of 100 times. You can learn more on how to calculate the margin of error for different confidence levels in a statistics class.    Let's say we asked a random sample of 100 students at Portland Community College and found that they spent an average of $451.32 on books their first year, plus or minus $85.63. Write this as a confidence interval, assuming a 95% confidence level.    If the margin of error was calculated to be plus or minus $85.63, then with a confidence level of 95% we could say that the average amount spent by the population is somewhere between $365.69 and $536.95.  These values are found by computing and   We could also write this as a confidence interval : ($365.69, $536.95).  Now we have come full circle and seen how we can use data from a sample to estimate the parameter we were interested in for our population.      Exercises   Describe the difference between a sample and a population.   A sample is a sub group of the population. A population is the entire group of subjects.    Describe the difference between a statistic and a parameter.   A Statistic is a measurement obtained from the data taken from a sample. A parameter is a measurement obtained from the data of the entire population.    The ASPCC randomly selects 200 students from PCC Cascade campus to participate in a childcare survey in order to determine the demand for additional childcare options for PCC students.   Who is the intended population?    What is the sample?    Is the collected data representative of the intended population? Why or why not?      The intended population is all PCC students.   All PCC Students    200 students from PCC Cascade campus    The collected data is not representative of all PCC students since it only includes responses from students at Cascade campus. This is an example of sampling bias.       A local research firm randomly selects 1200 homes in Washington County to determine support for adding compost pick up to residents' regular garbage service.   Who is the intended population?    What is the sample?    Is the collected data representative of the intended population? Why or why not?         The intended population is all Washington County residences.    1200 homes in Washington County    The collected data is likely representative since residences were selected at random from the entire county.       A political scientist surveys 28 of the current 106 representatives in a state's congress. Of them, 14 said they were supporting a new education bill, 12 said there were not supporting the bill, and 2 were undecided.     Who is the population of this survey?    What is the size of the population?    What is the size of the sample?    Give the statistic for the percentage of representatives surveyed who said they were supporting the education bill.    If the margin of error was 5%, give the confidence interval for the percentage of representatives we might we expect to support the education bill and explain what the confidence interval tells us.         The representatives in a state's congress.    The population size is     The sample size is in     The statistic is or 50%    The confidence interval is and tells us that the true percentage of the state congress representatives in support of the new education (the parameter) likely lies between 45% and 55%.       The city of Raleigh has 9,500 registered voters. There are two candidates for city council in an upcoming election: Brown and Feliz. The day before the election, a telephone poll of 350 randomly selected registered voters was conducted. 112 said they'd vote for Brown, 207 said they'd vote for Feliz, and 31 were undecided.     Who is the population of this survey?    What is the size of the population?    What is the size of the sample?    Give the statistic for the percentage of voters surveyed who said they'd vote for Brown.    If the margin of error was 3.5%, give the confidence interval for the percentage of voters surveyed that we might we expect to vote for Brown and explain what the confidence interval tells us.         All registered voters in the city of Raleigh.    The population size is     The sample size is     The statistic is or 32%    The confidence interval is and tells us that the true percentage of registered voters who will vote for Brown is likely to lie between 28.5% and 35.5%.

Observational study    Experiment    Observational study       A team of researchers is testing the effectiveness of a new vaccine for human papilloma virus (HPV). They randomly divide the subjects into two groups. Group 1 receives new HPV vaccine, and Group 2 receives the existing HPV vaccine. The patients in the study do not know which group they are in.     Which is the treatment group?    Which is the control group (if there is one)?    Is this study blind, double-blind, or neither?    Is this best described as an experiment, a controlled experiment, or a placebo-controlled experiment?         Group 1    Group 2    Blind because the patients in the study do not know.    Controlled experiment       Studies are often done by pharmaceutical companies to determine the effectiveness of a treatment. Suppose that a new cancer treatment is under study. Of interest is the average length of time in months patients live once starting the treatment. Two researchers each follow a different set of 40 cancer patients throughout this new treatment.     What is the population of this study?    Would you expect the data from the two researchers to be identical? Why or why not?    If the first researcher collected their data by randomly selecting 8 patients from each of 5 local hospitals, which sampling method did they use?    If the second researcher collected their data by choosing 40 patients they knew, what sampling method did they use? What concerns would you have about this data set, based upon the data collection method?         Cancer patients    No because sampling has variability    Stratified    Convenient Sample. It does not represent the population.       For the clinical trials of a weight loss drug containing Garcinia Cambogia the subjects were randomly divided into two groups. The first received an inert pill along with an exercise and diet plan, while the second received the test medicine along with the same exercise and diet plan. The patients do not know which group they are in, nor do the fitness and nutrition advisors.     Which is the treatment group?    Which is the control group (if there is one)?    Is this study blind, double-blind, or neither?    Is this best described as an experiment, a controlled experiment, or a placebo-controlled experiment?         2nd Group    Inert pill group    Double Blind because the patients and the advisors do not know who is in each group.    Placebo-controlled experiment       A study is conducted to determine whether people learn better with routine or crammed studying. Subjects volunteer from an introductory psychology class. At the beginning of the semester 12 subjects volunteer and are assigned to the routine studying group. At the end of the semester 12 subjects volunteer and are assigned to the crammed studying group.     Identify the target population and the sample.    Is this an observational study or an experiment?    This study involves two kinds of non-random sampling: 1. Subjects are not randomly sampled from a specified population and 2. Subjects are not randomly assigned to groups. Which problem is more serious? What effect on the results does each have?         All students    Experiment    It is only looking at one class and not all groups that are in the population so Subjects are not randomly sampled from a specified population.       To test a new lie detector, two groups of subjects are given the new test. One group is asked to answer all the questions truthfully. The second group is asked to tell the truth on the first half of the questions and lie on the second half. The person administering the lie detector test does not know what group each subject is in. Does this experiment have a control group? Is it blind, double-blind, or neither? Explain.   The control group would be the group that were ask to tell the truth. It is a blind study because the person who is administering the lie detector test doesn't know which group each person is in.    A poll found that 30%, plus or minus 5% of college freshmen prefer morning classes to afternoon classes.     What is the margin of error?    Write the survey results as a confidence interval.

Describe a controlled experiment the farmer could use to test his theory.   Play Barry Manilow to half the crop and don't play any music to the other half of the crop.    A sports psychologist believes that people are more likely to be extroverted as an adult if they played team sports as a child. Describe two possible studies to test this theory. Design one as an observational study and the other as an experiment. Which is more practical?   Answer will vary. Here is one potential solution.  Observational: Survey adults who played sports as a child. Ask them if they consider themselves extroverted or introverted. Record the percentage of each personality type.  Experimental: Survey adults and ask them if they played sports as children. Ask them if they consider themselves extroverted or introverted. Compare the results of adults who played sports as children with the adults who didn't play sports as children.  Which is more practical? The Experimental study would allow you to see if there is a significant difference in the personality types based on if the person played sports or didn't play sports.    Find a newspaper or magazine article, or the online equivalent, describing the results of a recent study (not a simple poll). Give a summary of the study's findings, then analyze whether the article provided enough information to determine the validity of the conclusions. If not, produce a list of things that are missing from the article that would help you determine the validity of the study. Look for the things discussed in the text: population, sample, randomness, blind, control, margin of error, etc.   Answers will vary depending on the article.    Use a polling website such as or and search for a poll that interests you. Find the result, the margin of error and confidence level for the poll and write the confidence interval.   Answers will vary depending on the poll being studied.    "

  "body": " In November 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Up until right before the election, most polls showed he had little chance of winning. There were several contributing factors to the polls not reflecting the actual intent of the electorate:   Ventura was running on a third-party ticket and most polling methods are better suited to a two-candidate race.    Many respondents to polls may have been embarrassed to tell pollsters that they were planning to vote for a professional wrestler.    The mere fact that the polls showed Ventura had little chance of winning might have prompted some people to vote for him in protest to send a message to the major-party candidates.     But one of the major contributing factors was that Ventura recruited a substantial amount of support from young people, particularly college students, who had never voted before and who registered specifically to vote in that election. The polls did not deem these young people likely voters (since in most cases young people have a lower rate of voter registration and a lower turnout rate for elections) so the polling samples were subject to sampling bias : they omitted a portion of the electorate that was weighted in favor of the winning candidate.

This study was conducted by the Wrigley Science Institute, a branch of the Wrigley chewing gum company. This is an example of a self-interest study; one in which the researches have a vested interest in the outcome of the study. While this does not necessarily mean the study was biased, we should subject the study to extra scrutiny.    Consider online reviews of products and businesses. Customers tend to leave reviews if they are very satisfied or very dissatisfied. While you can look for overall patterns and get useful information, these reviews suffer from voluntary response bias and likely capture more extreme views than the general population.    A survey asks participants a question about their interactions with people of different ethnicities. This study could suffer from response bias. A respondent might give an untruthful answer to not be perceived as racist.    An employer puts out a survey asking their employees if they have a drug abuse problem and need treatment help. Here, answering truthfully might have serious consequences; responses might not be accurate if there is a perceived lack of anonymity and employees fear retribution.    A survey asks, “Do you support funding research on alternative energy sources to reduce our reliance on high-polluting fossil fuels?” This is an example of a loaded or leading question – questions whose wording leads the respondent towards a certain answer.    A poll was conducted by phone with the question, “Do you often have time to relax and read a book?” Fifty percent of the people who were called refused to participate in the survey (Probably because they didn't have the time). It is unlikely that the results will be representative of the entire population. This is an example of non-response bias.     "

Write this as a confidence interval, assuming a 95% confidence level.    If the margin of error was calculated to be plus or minus $85.63, then with a confidence level of 95% we could say that the average amount spent by the population is somewhere between $365.69 and $536.95.  These values are found by computing and   We could also write this as a confidence interval : ($365.69, $536.95).

The raw data is not very useful by itself. In this section we will begin with graphical presentations of data and in the rest of the chapter we will learn about numerical summaries of data.   Alternative Video Lessons      Types of Data  There are two types of data, categorical data and quantitative data.   Categorical (qualitative) data are pieces of information that allow us to classify the subjects into various categories.   We might conduct a survey to determine the name of the favorite movie that people saw in a movie theater. When we conduct such a survey, the responses would look like: Finding Nemo, Black Panther, Titanic, etc.   We can count the number of people who give each answer, but the answers themselves do not have any numerical values: we cannot perform computations with an answer like Black Panther because it is categorical data.    Quantitative data are responses that are numerical in nature and with which we can perform meaningful calculations.   A survey could ask the number of movies you have seen in a movie theater in the past 12 months (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...). This would be quantitative data.   Other examples of quantitative data would be the running time of the movie you saw most recently (104 minutes, 137 minutes, 110 minutes, etc.) or the amount of money you paid for a movie ticket the last time you went to a movie theater ($5.50, $9.75, $10.50, etc.).  We cannot assume that all numbers are quantitative data, and sometimes it is not so clear-cut. Here are some examples to illustrate this.      Suppose we gather respondents' ZIP codes in a survey to track their geographical location. ZIP codes are numbers, but we can't do any meaningful calculations with them (it doesn't make sense to say that 98036 is \"twice\" 49018 — that's like saying that Lynnwood, WA is \"twice\" Battle Creek, MI, which doesn't make sense at all), so ZIP codes are really categorical data.    A survey about the movie you most recently saw includes the question, \"How would you rate the movie?\" with these possible answers:   It was awful.    It was just okay.    I liked it.    It was great.    Best movie ever!        Again, there are numbers associated with the responses, but these are really categories. A movie that rates a 4 is not necessarily twice as good as a movie that rates a 2, whatever that means; However, we often see that a movie got an average of 3.7 stars, which is an average of categorical ratings and it can give us important information.   Overall, it is important to look at the purpose of the study for any variables that could be classified as either categorical or quantitative. Another consideration is what you plan to do with the data. Next, we will talk about how to display each type of data.    Presenting Categorical Data  Since we can't do calculations with categorical data, we begin by summarizing the data in a frequency table or a relative frequency table.    Frequency Tables  A frequency table has one column for the categories, and another for the frequency , or number of times that category occurred.   An insurance company determines vehicle insurance premiums based on known risk factors. If a person is considered a higher risk, their premiums will be higher. One potential factor is the color of your car. The insurance company believes that people with some color cars are more likely to get in accidents. To research this, they examine police reports for recent total-loss collisions. The data is summarized in this table.     Car Color  Frequency of Total- Loss Collisions    Blue  25    Green  52    Red  41    White  36    Black  39    Grey  23    Total  216        Relative Frequency Tables  Numbers are usually not as easy to interpret as percentages, so we will add a column for the relative frequencies. A relative frequency is the percentage for the category, found by dividing each frequency by the total and converting to a percentage. You'll notice the percentages may not add up to exactly 100% due to rounding.    continued     Car Color  Frequency of Total- Loss Collisions  Relative Frequency of Total-Loss Collisions    Blue  25  or 11.6%    Green  52  or 24.1%    Red  41  or 19.0%    White  36  or 16.7%    Black  39  or 18.1%    Grey  23  or 10.7%    Total  216  or 100%     It would be even more useful to have a visual to see what is going on, and this is where charts and graphs come in. For categorical data we can display our data using bar graphs and pie charts.     Bar graphs  A bar graph is a graph that displays a bar for each category with the height of the bar indicating the frequency of that category. To construct a bar graph with vertical bars, we label the horizontal axis with the categories. The vertical axis will have a scale for the frequency or relative frequency.   The highest frequency in our car data is 52 collisions, so we will set our vertical axis to go from 0 to 55, with a scale of 5 units. To draw bar graphs by hand graph paper is useful, or you can use technology. It is also very helpful to label each bar with the frequency or relative frequency.   This is a bar graph. Along the x-axis it lists: blue, green, red, white, black and grey. The x-axis is labeled “Vehicle color involved in total-loss collision.” The y-axis is labeled “frequency” and goes from 0 to 55 with a scale of 5. Above each color there is a bar corresponding to the frequency. Blue 25; Green 52; Red 41; White 36; Black 39; Grey 23.      Pie Charts  A natural way to visualize relative frequencies is with a pie chart. A pie chart is a circle with wedges cut of varying sizes like slices of pizza or pie. The size of each wedge corresponds to the relative frequency of the category. The slices add up to 100%, just like relative frequencies. Pie charts can often benefit from including frequencies or relative frequencies in the pie slices.   Pie charts look nice but are harder to draw by hand than bar charts since to draw them accurately we would need to compute the angle each wedge cuts out of the circle, then measure the angle with a protractor. A spreadsheet is much better suited to drawing pie charts.   A pie chart for the same data as the previous bar chart. The relative frequencies are given in each pie piece: Green 24%; Red 19%; Black 18%; White 17%; Blue 11%; Grey 11%.      Using a Spreadsheet to Make Bar Charts and Pie Charts  To make a graph using a spreadsheet, place the data from the frequency table into the cells. Then select the data, go to the Insert tab, and choose the bar graph or pie chart that you would like. For this example, we will choose a pie graph.    This is a large screen shot of excel that includes both the data and the Insert tab with various circle graph options.    After the spreadsheet has created your pie graph you can choose which design you prefer by clicking on the Chart Design tab. Since these pie pieces represent car colors, we matched the color of each wedge to the color of the car in our pie chart above.  To give your graph a meaningful title, click on Chart Title. There are many other settings that you can experiment with.    This is a screenshots of excel that shows the frequency table and pie chart and shows the Chart Design Tab.      Misleading Graphs  Graphs can be misleading intentionally or unintentionally. It's better to keep them simple, clear and well-labeled. People sometimes add features to graphs that don't help convey their information.    3-dimensional bar chart like the one shown is usually not as effective as a 2-dimensional graph. The extra dimension does not add any useful information.   A 3-D bar graph showing the car color data.    Here is another way that fanciness can sometimes lead to trouble. Instead of plain bars, it is tempting to substitute images. This type of graph is called a pictogram.     Perceptual Distortion  A pictogram is a statistical graphic in which the size of the picture is intended to represent the frequency or size of the values being represented. We need to be careful with these, because our brains perceive the relationship between the areas, not the heights.   A labor union might produce this graph to show the difference between the average manager salary and the average worker salary.   The average manager salary is twice as high as the average worker salary as in a bar graph, but the image is also twice as wide. That makes it look like the manager salary is 4 times as large as the worker salary. The area needs to accurately portray the relationship, otherwise we will have a perceptual distortion.   There are two bags of money shown. One is larger labeled Mananger Salaries. The other is half as tall and half as wide and labeled workers salaries. There are no numbers or scale shown.       Misleading Scale  Another type of distortion in bar charts results from setting the baseline to a value other than zero. The baseline is the bottom of the vertical axis, representing the least number of cases that could have occurred in a category. Normally, this number should be zero.   Compare the two graphs below showing support for same-sex marriage rights from a poll taken in December, 2008 CNN\/Opinion Research Corporation Poll. Dec 19-21, 2008, from . At a glance, the two graphs suggest very different stories. The second graph makes it look like more than three times as many people oppose marriage rights as support them. But when we look at the scale we can see that the difference is about 12%. By not starting at zero the difference looks enlarged.    A bar graph with a scale from 0-100%; There is a bar for support at about 44% and a bar for oppose at about 56%.    A bar graph of the same data but the scale goes from 40-60%; This magnifies the difference between the support and oppose groups.       Stacked Bar Graphs  Another type of graph that can be hard to read and sometimes misleading is a stacked bar graph. In a stacked bar graph , the values we are comparing are stacked on top of each other vertically.   The table lists college expenses for two different students and we want to compare them. A stacked bar graph shows the expenses stacked vertically, but we are interested in the differences, not the totals.     Expense  Student 1  Student 2    Rent  $500  $650    Food  $125  $125    Tuition  $1750  $1450    Books  $325  $275    Misc  $100  $175       A stacked bar graph with the bars for the expenses for student 2 placed on top of the bars for student 1.    A side-by-side bar graph with the bars for each student right next to each other.    It is much easier to interpret the differences in a side-by-side bar chart.     Presenting Quantitative Data  With categorical data, the horizontal axis is the category, but with quantitative, or numerical, data we have numbers. If we have repeated values we can also make a frequency table.   A teacher records scores on a 20-point quiz for the 30 students in their class. The scores are:  19, 20, 18, 18, 17, 18, 19, 17, 20, 18, 20, 16, 20, 15, 17, 12, 18, 19, 18, 19, 17, 20, 18, 16, 15, 18, 20, 5, 0 and 0.  Here is a frequency table with the scores grouped and put in order.     Quiz Score  Frequency of Students    0  2    15  1    12  1    15  2    16  2    17  4    18  8    19  4    20  6      Using this table, it would be possible to create a standard bar chart from this summary, like we did for categorical data. However, since the scores are numerical values, this chart wouldn't make sense; the first and second bars would be five values apart, while the later bars would only be one value apart. Instead, we will treat the horizontal axis as a number line. This type of graph is called a histogram.    Histograms  A histogram is like a bar graph, but the horizontal axis is a number line. Unlike a bar graph, there are no spaces between the bars. Here are two histograms for the data given above. Notice that in the one on the left, the two scores of 15 are to the right of 15, or between 15 and 16. The horizontal scales on histograms can be confusing for this reason. Some people choose to have bars start at ½ values to avoid this ambiguity, as in the one on the right.    This is a histogram the x-axis is labeled score and goes from 0 to 21, with a scale of 1. The y-axis is labeled frequency an goes from 0 to 9 with a scale of 1. There are no spaces between the bars.    This is a histogram of the same data but this time the spaces are labeled 0 to 20 instead of the tick marks.    If we have a large number of different data values, a frequency table listing every possible value would be way too long. There would be too many bars on the histogram to reveal any patterns. For this reason, it is common with quantitative data to group data into class intervals.    Class Intervals   Class intervals are groupings of the data. In general, we define class intervals so that:   Each interval is equal in size. For example, if the first class contains values from 120-134, the second class should include values from 135-149.    We typically have somewhere between 5 and 20 classes, depending on the number of data values we're working with.     In the next example, we'll make a histogram using class intervals.   Suppose we have collected weights from 100 subjects who identify as male, as part of a nutrition study. For our weight data, we have values ranging from a low of 121 pounds to a high of 263 pounds, giving a total span of .  There are many ways to draw a histogram and we will explain one way as an example. We will create 10 classes by doing the following calculation: Take the range of 142 and divide it by 10 to find the class width.     Then we round up the class width so that the largest data value will be in one of the classes. So we round up to a class width of 15. Since the minimum data value is 121, we will choose 120 to start with since it is a multiple of 15 that is less than 121.     Interval  Frequency    120-134  4    135-149  14    150-164  16    165-179  28    180-194  12    195-209  8    210-224  7    225-239  6    240-254  2    255-269  3     This is a histogram of the data in the table; the x-axis is labeled weights(pounds) and goes from 120 to 270, with a scale of 15; The y-axis is labeled frequency and goes from 0 to 30 with a scale of 5. There are no spaces between the bars.     When using class intervals, it is much easier to use technology that was specifically designed to make histograms. GeoGebra is one program that lets you adjust the class widths to see which graph best displays the data.    Histograms Using Technology  We will be using GeoGebra throughout this chapter to make graphs and calculate summary statistics. There is an online version and one you can download at . To access the online version, select \"GeoGebra Classic from the GeoGebra home page. To download it, select \"App Downloads\" from the home page. The instructions are similar for both.   The first thing we need to do is enter the data in GeoGebra's spreadsheet. You can access the spreadsheet from Main Menu View Spreadsheet. Next, enter your data and select that column. Then click on the histogram icon in the menu bar on the left side and select One Variable Analysis.   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the icon for One Variable Analysis     A new window will pop up showing a visual of the data. There is a drop-down menu for the type of graph, but histogram is the default. Notice that the bars are not lined up with the tick-marks at the bottom, so we want to edit this histogram. The slider bar at the top will let you see different class widths, but we want to choose our class widths manually.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the histogram     If you close the menu at the top right by clicking on the left pointing triangle, you will see a settings wheel. Click on the wheel and check the box for set classes manually. To match our previous histogram, we will start at 120 pounds and set a class width of 15 pounds.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the box checked for Set Classes Manually.     Now the bars of the histogram match our previous graph, but we need to edit the axis labels to match. Click on the graph tab on the right side and uncheck the box for automatic dimensions. We set the x min, x max, x step, y min, y max and y step as shown.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the box uncheckd for Automatic Dimensions. The dimensions entered are xMin 111; xMax 275; xStep 15; yMin -3.4033; yMax: 30.8; yStep 5 (The y-dimensions were automatic)     To put the graph in an assignment or a book such as this one, select the export icon and choose Export as Picture. The downloaded version also has a Copy to Clipboard option. Then insert the graph into any document and add axis labels.   A screenshot from GeoGebra showing the export icon    Here is our finished histogram:    The finished histogram from GeoGebra copied into a Word document. This is the same histogram as in Example 10.      The Shape of a Distribution  Once we have our histogram, we can use it to determine the shape of the data or distribution . When describing distributions, we are going to look at four characteristics: shape, center, spread and outliers. Center and spread (variation) will be covered in the next two sections.    Modality  The modality of a distribution indicates the number of peaks or hills in its histogram.   It is unimodal if it has one peak.    It is bimodal if it has two peaks.    It is multimodal if it has multiple peaks.      The first graph is unimodal , the second is bimodal and the third is multimodal .    Three histograms are shown. The first histogram has one peak. The second histograms has two peaks. The third histogram has three peaks.     A bimodal distribution can result when two different populations have been grouped together and they are overlapping. It would be better to separate them into two separate graphs. For example, the grams of sugar per serving in sugar and non-sugar cereals.    Symmetry  A distribution is symmetric if the left side of the graph mirrors the right side.   The graph on the left is symmetric and unimodal while the graph on the right is roughly symmetric and bimodal.    Two histograms are shown. The first histogram has one peak in the middle and the bars taper down symmetrically on each side. The second histogram has two peaks. Each of the peaks are similar in size and the graph is roughly symmetric.       Skewness  If a distribution is not symmetric then we say it is skewed. A graph can be skewed to the left or skewed to the right . We say it is skewed in the direction of the longer tail.    Skewed to the Left  A left skewed graph is also called a negatively skewed graph. The longer tail will be on the left or negative side.    This is a histogram with 9 bars. The highest bar is to the right of center and the bars go down to the left gradually.      Skewed to the Right  A right skewed graph is also called a positively skewed graph. The longer tail will be on the right or positive side.    This is a histogram with 9 bars. The highest bar is to the left of center and the bars go down to the right gradually.      The Normal Distribution  The normal distribution has a very specific shape. It is unimodal and symmetric with a bell-shaped graph.         Outlier   Outliers are data values that are unusually far away from the rest of the data. There is often a gap between the outlier and the rest of the graph. This visual determination of outliers is often subjective and depends on the situation.    In the graph to the right we have a unimodal distribution that is skewed to the right. There appears to be an outlier near 20.   This distribution has majority of it's data on the left there is a gap in the graph with one bar further away.       Exercises   True or False: The bars of a histogram should always touch.   True    True or False: The bars of a bar graph should always touch.

There are seven bars, one from 40-50, one from 50-60, one from 60-70, one from 70-80, one from 80-90, one from 90-100, and one from 100-110. The y-axis is labeled Frequency and the scale goes from 0 to 8 by two. The 40-50 bar goes to 1, the 50-60 bar goes to 4, the 60-70 bar goes to 3, the 70-80 bar goes to 6, the 80-90 bar goes to 5, the 90-100 bar goes to 2, and the 100-110 bar goes to 3.      The data is unimodal. There are no obvious outliers. The data is either symmetric or skewed left.       This graph shows the number of adults and kids who prefer each type of soda. There were 130 adults and kids surveyed. Discuss some ways in which the graph could be improved.    This is a 3 dimensional double bar graph. There is a bar for kids and a bar for adults. The x-axis is labeled coke, diet coke, sprite and cherry soda. The y-axis starts at 20 and goes to 45 with a scale of 5.     The graph would be more effective at displaying the true differences between the categories if the vertical scale started at 0. The vertical axis is missing a label and units, so we can't tell if those are frequencies or relative frequencies. A flat bar graph (instead of the 3d graph) would be easier to read.    A poll was taken asking people if they agreed with the positions of the 4 candidates for a county office. Does this pie chart present a good representation of this data? Explain.    A pie chart with 4 regions: Nguyen is labeled 42%, McKee is labeled 35%, Jones is labeled 64% and Brown is labeled 52%.     No, this chart does not present a good representation of this data. The percentages in a pie chart must add to 100%, but these add to 193%. A bar chart would be appropriate for this data.    Why is this a misleading or poor graph?    This is a bar graph and is titled \"Favorite Drinks\". The x-axis is labeled Drink Type and includes colas, lemon flavored, root beer, teas, coffee, and other. The y-axis is labeled frequency and has no scale.     This is a poor graph because the vertical axis does not have a numerical scale, so we cannot know how many have each drink as a favorite drink. We also don't know if the bottom vertical line represents 0, which is potentially misleading.    Why is this a misleading or poor graph?    This is a bar graph and is titled \"Profit During First Half of Year\". The x-axis is labeled Year and includes January, February, March, April, May, and June. The y-axis is labeled Profits in $. The scale goes from 0 to 4500 by 500. The bar for each month is labeled with the following values: January 4230, February 3760, March 2670, April -1320, May 750, and June 1560. The bar for April is colored red while the remaining bars are colored blue.     This is a misleading graph because the -$1320 in April represents a loss (instead of a profit), but the height of the bar for April looks like a profit. Also, the horizontal axis label is Year , but the bar labels are months.    Match each description to one of the graphs.

The bars drop off slightly faster to the right.      The bars in this histogram increase sharply to the tallest bars on the left side, then decrease and increase to the second tallest bar, then decrease again to the right.    The bars on this histogram start out at a middle height and then go down and up in a U shape to the tallest bar to the right of center. Then the bars decrease and increase again for another tall bar on the right.    The bars on this histogram gradually increase to the right and drop of quickly after the peak toward the right side of the graph.        This distribution is unimodal and right skewed. There is a possible outlier between 10 and 11.    This distribution is unimodal and symmetric. There are no outliers.    This distribution is unimodal and right skewed. There are no obvious outliers.    This distribution is multimodal and left skewed. There are no outliers.    This distribution is unimodal and left skewed. There are no obvious outliers.       Studies are often done by pharmaceutical companies to determine the effectiveness of a treatment. Suppose that a new cancer drug is currently under study. Of interest is the average length of time in months patients live once starting the treatment. Two researchers each follow a different set of 40 cancer patients throughout their treatment. The following data (in months) are collected.   Create a histogram for each dataset, using the same class intervals and scales so you can compare them.    Compare and contrast the two distributions.  Researcher 1: 3, 4, 11, 15, 16, 17, 22, 44, 37, 16, 14, 24, 25, 15, 26, 27, 33, 29, 35, 44, 13, 21, 22, 10, 12, 8, 40, 32, 26, 27, 31, 34, 29, 17, 8, 24, 18, 47, 33, 34  Researcher 2: 3, 14, 11, 5, 16, 17, 28, 41, 31, 18, 14, 14, 26, 25, 21, 22, 31, 2, 35, 44, 23, 21, 21, 16, 12, 18, 41, 22, 16, 25, 33, 34, 29, 13, 18, 24, 23, 42, 33, 29                     The data for patients of both researchers is symmetric. Researcher's 1 patients' data appears to be unimodal, but Researcher 2's patients' data may be bimodal or multimodal. The data for Researcher 1's patients does not have any outliers, but the data for Researcher's 2 may have outliers between 0 and 5 months or 40 and 45 months.       "

A survey about the movie you most recently saw includes the question, \"How would you rate the movie?\" with these possible answers:   It was awful.    It was just okay.    I liked it.    It was great.    Best movie ever!        Again, there are numbers associated with the responses, but these are really categories. A movie that rates a 4 is not necessarily twice as good as a movie that rates a 2, whatever that means; However, we often see that a movie got an average of 3.7 stars, which is an average of categorical ratings and it can give us important information.

We want to know what an average value is (where the data is centered), and how spread out the values are. Together, the center and spread provide important information which can be used to estimate our population parameters. In this section we will discuss the measures of center and in the next section we will discuss the measures of spread.    Measures of Center  There are a few different types of averages that measure the center, and the one we use will depend on the shape of the distribution. We will mention the mode but focus mainly on the two most common averages : the mean and the median .    Mode  In the previous section, we saw that the modes are related to the peaks where similar values are grouped. The mode is the value with the highest frequency (A mode is the value where a peak occurs. One additional way to calculate the mode(s) is to take the midpoint of each peak in the histogram.)    Mean  The mean , or more formally the arithmetic mean, is what probably comes to mind when you hear the word average. The calculation of the mean uses every data value in the distribution and is therefore strongly affected by skew and outliers.  To calculate the mean of a distribution, we divide the sum of the data values by the number of data values we have. The sample mean is usually represented by, a lower-case with a bar over it, read-bar. The lower-case letter n is used to represent the number of data values or sample size .   Mean        Mirabel's exam scores for her last math class were: 79, 86, 82, 94. What is her mean test score?    To find the mean test score we need to find the sum of her test scores, then divide the sum by the number of test scores ( ). The mean is:   points  We will round the sample mean to one more decimal place than the original data. In this case, we would round 85.25 to 85.3 points. Also notice that the mean has the same units as the data and it is important to label it.    It is reasonable to calculate the mean by hand when the data set is small, but if the data set is large, or if you will be finding additional statistics, then technology is the way to go. We can find the mean of a data set using the spreadsheet formula =AVERAGE .   The price of peanut butter at 5 stores was $3.29, $3.59, $3.79, $3.75, and $3.99. Find the mean price using a spreadsheet. There are two ways to use the =AVERAGE formula. If your data set is not too large, you can enter each value directly into the formula. Using this method, we write   =AVERAGE(3.29 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, 3.99)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =AVERAGE formula typed in with the values.    and we get an answer of $3.68.  The other method is to enter the data values into a single column (or row) of the spreadsheet and reference the column (or row) range in the formula. We can enter the range by highlighting the data values. As illustrated below, if we enter the data into column A, the formula is   =AVERAGE(A1:A5)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =AVERAGE formula typed in with the cell references. The data is in column A    and we also get an answer of $3.68.   Sometimes when there is a lot of data with repeated values we are given a frequency table.   One hundred families from a particular neighborhood are randomly selected and asked to give their annual household income rounded to the nearest $5,000. The results are shown in the frequency table below.     Income (thousands of dollars)  Frequency    $15  6    $20  8    $25  11    $30  17    $35  19    $40  20    $45  12    $50  7     Calculating the mean by hand could get tedious if we try to type in all 100 values:     We could calculate this more easily by noticing that adding 15 to itself six times is the same as . Using this simplification, we get     The mean household income of our sample is 33.9 thousand dollars or $33,900.   We could also use =AVERAGE to find the mean for this example, but it would require entering each repeated value individually. If the mean is all we need, then taking advantage of multiplication as repeated addition is the more straightforward way to go. We could also enter the frequency table and the calculation above in a spreadsheet.   Extending the last example, suppose a new family moves into the neighborhood and has a household income of $5 million ($5000 thousand). Adding this to our sample, our mean becomes:     While 83.1 thousand dollars, or $83,100 is the correct mean household income for the new sample, it is no longer representative of the neighborhood – in fact, it is greater than every income in the sample aside from the new one we added!   Imagine the data values on a see-saw or balance scale. The mean is the value at the tip of the triangle that keeps the data in balance, like in the picture below.    A drawing of a see-saw with rectangles to indicate the data values. Most of the data values are to the left of the fulcrum; the two values to the right are spread out which causes the data to be balanced.    If we graph our household data, the $5 million value is so far out to the right that the mean has to adjust to keep things in balance.    With the outlier data value added, the see-saw is extended with that value far to the right. Now all of the original data values are to the left of the fulcrum.    For this reason, when working with data that is skewed or has outliers, it is common to use a different measure of center, the median.    Median  The median of a data set is the middle value, when the data are listed in order from smallest to largest. We can also think of the median as the value that has 50% of the data below it and 50% of data above it. As we will discover later, the median is also the 50th percentile .   Median  If the number of data values is odd, then the median is the middle data value If the number of data values is even, then the median is the mean of the middle pair    When finding the median of an odd number of values.  Use the following quiz scores: 5, 10, 8, 6, 4, 8, 2, 5, 7, 7, 6  We must start by listing the data in order: 2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10.  It is helpful to mark or cross off the numbers as you list them to make sure you don't miss any. Also, be sure to count the number of data values in your ordered list to make sure it matches the number of data values in the original list.  In this example there are 11 quiz scores. When the distribution contains an odd number of data values there will be a single number in the middle and that is the median. For small data sets, we can “walk” one value at a time from the ends of the ordered list towards the center to find the median     The median test score is 6 points.    When finding the median of an even number of values.  Use the following quiz scores: 2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10, 20.  There are now 12 quiz scores in our sample. When the distribution contains an even number of data values there will be a pair of values in the middle rather than a single value. Then we take the average of the middle two values.     Median points  What is important to notice is that despite adding an outlier to our data set, the median is largely unaffected. The median quiz score for the new distribution is 6.5 points.  We can also find the median using the spreadsheet formula =MEDIAN . Just like the spreadsheet function =AVERAGE , we can either list the individual data values in the formula, or we can enter the data values into a row (or column) and use the row range (or column range) in the formula.  Using the data values of the original distribution, we can write function as   =MEDIAN(2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10) or   =MEDIAN(A1:AK)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =MEDIAN formula typed in with the cell references. The data is in row 1    and we get 6 points for the median test score.    Let's continue with our peanut butter example and find the median both by hand and with a spreadsheet. The price of peanut butter at 5 stores was $3.29, $3.59, $3.79, $3.75, and $3.99.  To find the median by hand, we must first list the prices in order. This give us: $3.29, $3.59, $3.75, $3.79, $3.99  Since there are an odd number of data values in the sample ( ), we know that the median will be the single data value in the middle of the ordered list.     The median price of peanut butter at these five stores is $3.75.  Using a spreadsheet, we write   =MEDIAN(3.29, 3.59, 3.79, 3.75, 3.99)     A screenshot of Excel showing the =MEDIAN formula with all the data values typed in.    and we get a median price of $3.75.   It is worth noting that when you use a spreadsheet to find the median you do not have to order the data first. You can enter the data values in the order they are given to you.    The Relationship Between the Mean and the Median  If a distribution is skewed, the mean is pulled in the direction of the skew, as we saw in the see-saw diagram. In a right skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median, while in a left skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median. If the distribution is symmetric, the mean and the median will be approximately equal.  To demonstrate this, we have entered some data in GeoGebra, as previously explained, and made histograms. To see the statistics that GeoGebra calculates, we click on the summation symbol on the right-hand menu bar.   Fifty people from the Portland Metro area who are employed full time were sampled and their annual salaries were recorded (to the nearest thousand dollars). The histogram and summary statistics from GeoGebra are shown below.  From the histogram we can see that the shape of the distribution is unimodal and skewed to the right. We can see from the statistics output on the left that the mean is greater than the median. This is because the few people with higher incomes bring the average up.   Mean , Median , Mean Median   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram is skewed to the right. The statistics output shows the mean is $67,160 and the Median is $53,500.      A random selection of 30 math 105 exams at PCC were sampled and their scores were recorded. The histogram of the resulting distribution is shown below.  The shape of the distribution is unimodal and skewed to the left. There also appears to be an outlier between 20 and 30. We can see from the statistics output that the mean is less than the median. This is because the low test score brought the average down. points points   Mean points, Median points, Mean Median   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram is skewed to the left. The statistics output shows the mean is 81.7 points and the Median is 87.5 points.      Nineteen people identifying as female were sampled and their heights (in inches) were recorded. The histogram of the resulting distribution is shown below.  The shape of the distribution is unimodal and roughly symmetric. We can also see from the statistics output that the mean and the median are approximately equal. inches inches   Mean inches, Median inches Mean Median   A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram is approximately symmetric. The statistics output shows the mean is 62.6 inches and the Median is 62 inches.     We can use these observations in reverse as well. If we know the mean is greater than the median, then we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the right. If the mean is less than the median, then we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the left. When the mean and the median are approximately equal, the distribution is likely to be symmetric.    Recent college graduates were asked how much student loan debt they have. The data has a mean of $46,265 and a median of $33,652. Just based on this information, do you expect the distribution to be symmetric, skewed to the left, or skewed to the right?    Since the mean is greater than the median, we can expect the distribution to be skewed to the right.      Exercises   A group of diners were asked how much they would pay for a meal. Their responses were: $7.50, $25.00, $10.00, $10.00, $7.50, $8.25, $9.00, $5.00, $15.00, $8.00, $7.25, $7.50, $8.00, $7.00, $12.00.     Find the mean, including units.

The amount of commercials in an hour of television varies by channel. The total length (in minutes) of all commercials from 8 pm to 9 pm in for some selected broadcast and cable channels on a weekday evening were: 10, 12.75, 7, 9, 9.75, 6.5, 12.5, 12.5, 8.75, 17, 10.5, 2.

Use the following table is the cost of purchasing a car at a local dealership.  Some of the cars sold were new and some were used.     Calculate find the mean, including units.    Can you figure out how to find the median using the frequency table? See if you can do it without listing out all the data values.    Based on the mean and the median, would you expect the distribution to be symmetric skewed left or skewed right? Explain.

Then use the Show Statistics option.     The sum of the frequencies is 75, so        In GeoGebra Classic, enter the costs into the column A and frequencies into column B of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option.     Since there are 75 values (an odd number), we know that the median will be the single middle data value. Because , we know it will be the 38th value in the list. The 38th value is 35, so the median is 35 thousand dollars.    Since the mean is less than the median, we would expect the distribution to be skewed left.       As part of a study of email, a researcher counted the length of 34 emails. The lengths of the emails are shown below, rounded to the nearest thousand characters (so a length 0 means that the numbers of characters rounded to 0, not that the message was blank). The data is from Advanced High School Statistics, 2nd Ed. ( ).      Calculate and find the mean, including units.    Can you figure out how to find the median using the frequency table? See if you can do it without listing all the data values.    Based on the mean and the median, would you expect the distribution to be symmetric, skewed left, or skewed right?

Then use the Show Statistics option.     The sum of the frequencies is 34, so        In GeoGebra Classic, enter the costs into the column A and frequencies into column B of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option.     Since there are 34 values (an even number), we know that the median will be the mean of the two middle values. Because , we know the two middle values are the 17th and 18th values. The 17th value is 4, and the 18th value is 5, so the median is 4.5 thousand characters.    Since the mean is greater than the median, we expect the distribution to be skewed right.       Studies are often done by pharmaceutical companies to determine the effectiveness of a treatment. Suppose that a new cancer drug is currently under study. Of interest is the average length of time in months patients live once starting the treatment. Two researchers each follow a different set of 40 cancer patients throughout their treatment. The following data (in months) are collected.     Find the mean and median of each group.    Compare and contrast the two groups.     Researcher 1: 3, 4, 11, 15, 16, 17, 22, 44, 37, 16, 14, 24, 25, 15, 26, 27, 33, 29, 35, 44, 13, 21, 22, 10, 12, 8, 40, 32, 26, 27, 31, 34, 29, 17, 8, 24, 18, 47, 33, 34    Researcher 2: 3, 14, 11, 5, 16, 17, 28, 41, 31, 18, 14, 14, 26, 25, 21, 22, 31, 2, 35, 44, 23, 21, 21, 16, 12, 18, 41, 22, 16, 25, 33, 34, 29, 13, 18, 24, 23, 42, 33, 29 5.            For Researcher 1:  In Excel:   =average(3,4,11,15,16,17,22,44,37,16,14,24,25,15,26,27,33,29,35,44,13,21,22,10,12,8,40,32,26,27,31,34,29,17,8,24,18,47,33,34)    months.   =median(3,4,11,15,16,17,22,44,37,16,14,24,25,15,26,27,33,29,35,44,13,21,22,10,12,8,40,32,26,27,31,34,29,17,8,24,18,47,33,34)    months  The mean for Researcher 1's patients is 23.6 months, and the median for Researcher's 1 patients is 24 months.  For Researcher 2:  In Excel:   =average(3,14,11,5,16,17,28,41,31,18,14,14,26,25,21,22,31,2,35,44,23,21,21,16,12,18,41,22,16,25,33,34,29,13,18,24,23,42,33,29)    months   =median(3,14,11,5,16,17,28,41,31,18,14,14,26,25,21,22,31,2,35,44,23,21,21,16,12,18,41,22,16,25,33,34,29,13,18,24,23,42,33,29)    months  The mean for Researcher 2's patients is 22.8 months, and the median is 22 months    Both the mean and median for Researcher 1's patients are greater than the mean and median for Researcher 2's patients. So, on average, Researcher 1's patients have a longer life time after starting the cancer treatment than Researcher 2's patients.       The US Census Bureau, in addition to counting the population of the US every 10 years, conducts yearly informational surveys, such as the American Community Survey (ACS). For the 2012 ACS, a randomly chosen group of 20 respondents (10 males, 10 females) answered a question about their incomes. Data from Advanced High School Statistics, 2nd Ed. Section 2.1 Exercise #1. ( ).      Males: $53,000; $70,000; $12,800; 30,000; $4,500; $42,000; $48,000; $60,000; $108,000; $11,000    Females: $1,600; $1,200; $20,000; $25,000; $670; $29,000; $44,000; $30,000; $5,800; $50,000        Find the mean and median of each group.    Compare and contrast the two groups.         For Males:  In Excel   =average(53000,70000,12800,30000,4500,42000,48000,60000,108000,11000)       =median(53000,70000,12800,30000,4500,42000,48000,60000,108000,11000)      The mean for males is $43,930, and the median for males is $45,000.  For Females:   =average(1600,1200,20000,25000,670,29000,44000,30000,5800,50000)       =median(1600,1200,20000,25000,670,29000,44000,30000,5800,50000)      The mean for females is $20,727, and the median for females is $22,500    Both the mean income and median income for the males in the sample were twice as large as the mean income and median income for the females in the sample. The difference between the mean and median income for the females was slightly larger than the mean and median income for the males, so the distribution of incomes for the females is possibly more skewed than the distribution for the males.       An experiment compared the ability of three groups of participants to remember briefly-presented chess positions. The data are shown below. The numbers represent the average number of pieces correctly remembered from three chess positions.   Make a histogram for each group.    Find the mean of each group.    Find the median of each group    Compare the shapes of the distributions as well as the centers of the three groups.

You should check with your instructor to see if histograms are to be hand-drawn or computer generated. Answers will vary depending on the size of the margins and the programs you are using.    Histogram for Average Number of Pieces Correctly Remembered by Non-players     Histogram for Average Number of Pieces Correctly Remembered by Beginners      Histogram for Average Number of Pieces Correctly Remembered by Tournament Players       The mean number of pieces correctly remembered for non-players was 33.65 pieces.  The mean number of pieces correctly remembered for beginners was 47.6 pieces.  The mean number of pieces correctly remembered for tournament players was 64.98 pieces.    The median number of pieces correctly remembered for non-players was 33.5 pieces.  The median number of pieces correctly remembered for beginners was 51.3 pieces.  The median number of pieces correctly remembered for tournament players was 71.1 pieces.    The distribution for non-players appears to be uniform. The distribution for beginners looks unimodal and left-skewed. The distribution for tournament players appears bimodal and symmetric.  The mean and median number of pieces correctly remembered were both greatest for tournament players, with non-players having the smallest mean and median of pieces correctly remembered.       There is evidence that smiling can attenuate judgments of possible wrongdoing. This phenomenon termed the \"smile-leniency effect\" was the focus of a study by Marianne LaFrance & Marvin Hecht in 1995 LaFrance, M., & Hecht, M. A. (1995) Why smiles generate leniency. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, 207-214. Adapted from , by David M. Lane, et al, used under CC-BY-SA 3.0 . . The following data are measurements of how lenient the sentences were for three different types of smiles and one neutral control. A higher number indicates greater leniency. The same subject was used for all of the conditions so that may affect the results.   Make a histogram for each smile type and the neutral control.    Find the mean for each type of smile and the neutral control.    Find the median for each type of smile and the neutral control.    Compare the shapes of the distributions as well as the centers for each type of smile and control.

The mean leniency for the felt smile group was 4.9.  The mean leniency for the miserable smile group was 4.9.  The mean leniency for the neutral control group was 4.1.    The median leniency for the false smile group was 5.5.  The median leniency for the felt smile group was 4.8.  The median leniency for the miserable smile group was 4.8.  The median leniency for the neutral control group was 4.0.    Answers will vary depending on the graphs created. The shape of the false smile is bimodal, whereas the miserable smile and neutral control groups are both unimodal. The miserable smile and neutral control both appear to be skewed to the right, however, comparing the mean to the median we see that there is not much of a difference. Therefore, none of the graphs are skewed. The felt smile group is the most visually uniform. The measures of center (mean and median) have the center of the false smile near 5.5, the felt smile and miserable smile both near 4.8, and the control near 4       Make up three data sets with 5 values each that have:   The same mean but different medians    The same median but different means.         There are many possible answers for this problem. Three data sets with 5 values each that have the same mean but different medians are:     0,  0,  0,  0,  10    0,  0,  2,  4,  4    0,  1,  1,  1,  7       There are many possible answers for this problem. Three data sets with 5 values that have the same median but different means are:     10,  10,  10,  10,  10    0,  0,  10,  15,  20    1,  5,  10,  10,  10          The frequency table below shows the number of women's shoes that were sold in an hour at a local shoe store.     Would you treat this data as categorical or quantitative?    How would the bar graph be different from the histogram?    Treat the data as quantitative and find the mean and the median. Are these useful statistics?     Shoe Size  Frequency    5  4    6  4    7  6    8  6    9  5            Argument for categorical: Because it is not clear that the shoe sizes represent a measure, the data can be considered categorical.  Argument for quantitative: Because shoe size is a measurement that corresponds to the length of someone's foot, it can be treated as quantitative data.    Each graph would have frequency along the y-axis. In a bar graph the bars would have spaces between them and each bar would be labeled with the shoe size. In a histogram there would not be any spaces between the bars and the shoe sizes could be the scale on the x-axis.    The mean shoe size to be 7.2 and the median shoe size to be 7.  The mean shoe size is:     Since there are 25 values (an odd number), we know that the median will be the single middle data value. Because , we know it will be the 13th value in the list. The 13th value is 7, so the median shoe size is 7.  The mean and median shoe size might be useful statistics to the store. If shoe size is positively correlated to height, then a shoe store with a comparatively larger mean or median shoe size could determine that their clients are, on average, comparatively taller. (Other answers are possible.)       At the end of the term, 400 students take a final exam, and their scores (as percentages) are plotted in a histogram. Graph and description from Advanced High School Statistics, 2nd Ed. Section 2.2 Exercise. ( )     The bars gradually increase going to the right with the tallest bars near the right side of the graph, then they decrease sharply.       Is the graph shown above skewed right, skewed left, or symmetric? Explain why you chose your answer.    Based on your answer to part (a), which would you expect: that the mean is less than the median, the mean is greater than the median, or that the mean and median are equal?         This graph is skewed left.    I expect that the mean is less than the median because the graph is skewed left.       The following graph shows the distribution of yearly incomes of 40 patrons at a college coffee shop. Graph and description from Advanced High School Statistics, 2nd Ed. Section 2.2 Exercise. ( )     The bars on the histogram increase gradually with the tallest bars in the center, then decrease gradually.       Is the graph shown above skewed right, skewed right, or symmetric? Explain why you chose your answer.    Based on your answer to part (a), which would you expect: that the mean is less than the median, the mean is greater than the median, or that the mean and median are equal?         This graph is symmetric. The graph has a single peak between $65,000 an $66,000, and there are approximately an equal number of data values on either side of this peak.    I expect that the mean and median are equal because the graph is symmetric.       For each of the following distributions, would you expect that the mean is less than the median, greater than the median, or approximately equal to the median? Explain your reasoning.     Household incomes in the US    Weights of newborn babies born at term    The number of children in a household in the US    Medical costs for all adults    Medical costs for adults in the US older than 65         Incomes are skewed to the right so the mean would be greater than the median.    Weights are approximately symmetric so the mean would be about the same as the median.    Number of children is skewed to the right so the mean would be greater than the median.    Medical costs for all adults are most likely skewed to the right so the mean would be greater than the median.    Medical costs for adults 65+ may be symmetric or skewed to the right. Answer according to the shape you chose.       "

The shape of the false smile is bimodal, whereas the miserable smile and neutral control groups are both unimodal. The miserable smile and neutral control both appear to be skewed to the right, however, comparing the mean to the median we see that there is not much of a difference. Therefore, none of the graphs are skewed. The felt smile group is the most visually uniform.

  "body": " Summary Statistics: Measures of Variation   Summary Statistics: Measures of Variation   Students will be able to:     Calculate and describe the measures of variation: standard deviation, range and interquartile range (IQR)    Calculate the 5-number summary and construct boxplots by hand and\/or using technology (boxplots using technology may be modified or not)    Compare distributions with side-by-side boxplots and percentiles    Calculate and apply Z-scores       Alternative Video Lessons      Measures of Variation  Consider these three sets of quiz scores for a 10-point quiz:  Section A: 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5  Section B: 0 0 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 10  Section C: 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 6  All three data sets have a mean of 5 points and median of 5 points, yet the sets of scores are clearly quite different. In Section A, everyone had the same score; in Section B half the class got no points and the other half got a perfect score. Section C was not as consistent as section A, but not as widely varied as section B.  Thus, in addition to the mean and median, which are measures of center or the average value, we also need a measure of how spread out \" or varied each data set is.  There are several ways to measure the variation of a distribution. In this section we will look at the standard deviation , range and the interquartile range (IQR) .    Standard Deviation  The sample standard deviation, s , is a measure of variation that tells us how far, on average, the data values deviate, or are different from, the mean. The mean and standard deviation are paired to provide a measure of center and spread for symmetric distributions.   Sample Standard Deviation     where is the sample size, or the number of data values   We will go through the whole process for calculating the standard deviation. Let's say there is another section of quiz scores:  Section D: 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 10  The mean quiz score, like Sections A, B and C, is 5 points.  The first step in finding the standard deviation is to find the deviation, or difference, of each data value from the mean. We will do this in a table. You could also use a spreadsheet to do these calculations.     Data Value  Deviation: (Data Value – Mean)    0     5     5     5     5     5     5     5     5     10      We would like to get an idea of the average deviation from the mean, but if we find the average of the values in the second column, the negative and positive values cancel each other out (this will always happen), so to prevent this we square the deviations.     Data Value  Deviation: (Data Value – Mean)  Deviation Squared    0      5      5      5      5      5      5      5      5      10       Next, we add the squared deviations and we get     Ordinarily, we would then divide by the number of scores, , (in this case, 10) to find the mean of the deviations, but the division by is only done if the data set represents a population. When the data set represents a sample (as it almost always does), we divide by (in this case,).  We assume Section D represents a sample, so we will divide by 9. Note that our units are now points-squared since we squared all of the deviations. It is much more meaningful to use the units we started with, so to convert back to points we take the square root.  The sample standard deviation for Section D is     For comparison, here is the standard deviation for each section listed above:   points   points   points   points  For the standard deviation, we usually use two more decimal places than the original data. This tells us that on average, scores were 2.36 points away from the mean of 5 points. In summary, here are the steps to calculate the standard deviation by hand.   Calculating the Sample Standard Deviation     Find the deviations by subtracting the mean from each data value    Square each deviation    Add the squared deviations    Compute the square root of the sum divided by :         There are a few important characteristics we want to keep in mind when finding and interpreting the standard deviation.   The standard deviation is never negative. It will be zero if all the data values are equal and get larger as the data spreads out.    The standard deviation has the same units as the original data and it is important to label it.    The standard deviation, like the mean, can be highly influenced by outliers.      To continue our peanut butter example, we will find the standard deviation of this sample: $3.29, $3.59, $3.79, $3.75, and $3.99.  The first thing we need to find is the sample mean, and we know it is $3.68 from our previous work. Next, we need to find the deviation from the mean for each data value and square it.     Data Value  Deviation  Deviation Squared    $3.29      $3.59      $3.79      $3.75      $3.99       The sum of the deviations squared is     The sample standard deviation is     Since the units are dollars, we will round to two decimal places rather than two more than the data. This gives us a standard deviation of $0.26. Together with the mean this tells us that on average, the cost of a jar of peanut butter is $0.26 away from the mean of $3.68.   Calculating the standard deviation by hand can be quite a nuisance when we are dealing with a large data set, so we can also use technology. We use the spreadsheet function =STDEV.S to find the sample standard deviation. Notice that this is different from the population standard deviation, which uses the function =STDEV.P .  Just like the spreadsheet functions =AVERAGE and =MEDIAN , we can either list the individual data values in the formula, or we can enter the data values into a row or column and use the row or column range in the formula.    The total cost of textbooks for the term was collected from 36 students. Use a spreadsheet to find the mean, median, and standard deviation of the sample.  $140 $160 $160 $165 $180 $220 $235 $240 $250  $260 $280 $285 $285 $285 $290 $300 $300 $305  $310 $310 $315 $315 $320 $320 $330 $340 $345  $350 $355 $360 $360 $380 $395 $420 $460 $460  Since we are finding more than one statistic for this data set, it is much more efficient to enter the data values into a row or column and reference the range in each of the formulas. We enter the data into column A.     For the mean we enter: =AVERAGE(A1:A36) and get a result of $299.58.  For the median we enter: =MEDIAN(A1:A36) and get a result of $307.50.  For the standard deviation we enter: =STDEV.S(A1:A36) and get $78.68.   The mean and the median are relatively close to each other, so we can expect the distribution to be approximately symmetric with maybe a slight skew to the left, since the mean is smaller. The mean and standard deviation together tell us that the average cost of textbooks for a term is about $299.58, give or take $78.68.    In addition to a spreadsheet, we will continue our use of GeoGebra. Let's take a look at how to use GeoGeogebra to find the mean, median and standard deviation for the last example. We begin just like we did for making a histogram.    continued: We enter the textbook data into column A of the spreadsheet in GeoGebra. (Main Menu →View →Spreadsheet). Next, select the column title of your data, click on the histogram in the menu bar on the left, and select One Variable Analysis.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the icon for One Variable Analysis    Then you will see the histogram. It is always a good idea to check the shape of your distribution before calculating anything. Notice our histogram matches what we found about the distribution from the mean and median. It is approximately symmetric or slightly skewed to the left.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram. The summation symbol to show summary statistics is on the right side.    Next, we click the summation symbol in the menu bar on the right. The list of summary statistics will pop up as you can see in the image below. We see that the mean is $299.58, the median is $307.50 and the sample standard deviation is $78.68 – just like we found using the spreadsheet formulas.  The statistics we will use are the sample size , the mean, median, and the sample standard deviation . The last five entries in the table – min, Q1, median, Q3, and max – together make up the 5-number summary which we will learn about shortly!    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the data, histogram and summary statistics.    The standard deviation is the measure of variation that we pair with the mean for approximately symmetric distributions. This pairing should make sense because the standard deviation uses the mean in its calculation. But what about the median? What measure of variation do we pair with it?     Range  One candidate is the range . The range tells us the spread or width of the entire data set. We calculate the range as the difference between the maximum and minimum value.   Range      However, the range is not a very good measure of variation since it is very strongly affected by skew and outliers. Consider, for example, the distribution of full time salaries in the United States. Many people earn a minimum wage salary, while others like Jeff Bezos (Amazon) and Bill Gates (Microsoft) earn millions (if not billions!). A range this large does very little to help us get a sense of the spread where most of the data values lie.    Quartiles and the Interquartile Range  Instead, the measure of variation that we pair with the median is the interquartile range (IQR) . The IQR tells us the width of the middle 50% of data values. By cutting off the lower and upper 25% of data values, we are able to ignore extreme values and provide a more accurate sense of how spread out the distribution is.  The IQR is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). Before we can calculate the interquartile range, though, we need to learn how to find the first and third quartiles.   Interquartile Range (IQR)      As the name implies, quartiles are values that divide the data into quarters. The first quartile (Q1) is the value that 25% of the data lie below. The third quartile (Q3) is the value that 75% of the data lie below. As you might have guessed, the second quartile is the same as the median since 50% of the data values lie below it.  We have seen that the data is split in half by the median so to split it into quarters, we find the median of each half of the data.   Quartiles   the median of the lower half of the data   is the median of the whole data set   is the median of the upper half of the data  If there is an odd number of data values, we don't use the median in either half     (even number of data values): Suppose we have measured the height, in inches, of 12 people who identify as female. The data values are listed below. Find the interquartile range.  59 60 69 64 70 72 66 64 67 66 63 61    Just like when finding the median, we must first order the data.  59 60 61 63 64 64 66 66 67 69 70 72  Then we divide the data into two halves. In the case of an even sample size, we split the distribution down the middle. The first 6 data values are the lower half and the next 6 data values are the upper half. Then we find the median of each. The median of the lower half is Q1 and the median of the upper half is Q3.     In this data inches, and inches. Then we subtract to find the IQR.     This tells us the that the middle 50% of the women's heights lie within an interval of 6 inches.     (odd number of data values): Suppose we added one more height (68 inches) to the data set from the previous example. We will again find the interquartile range of the heights.  59 60 61 63 64 64 66 66 67 68 69 70 72  The data are already in order, but we have an odd number of values. To deal with this we do not use the median in the upper or lower halves. The lower half will include the values strictly below the median, and the upper half will include the values strictly above the median.     Then the interquartile range is:     If the data set is small, we can find the first and third quartiles by hand, but we have also seen that they are part of the output from GeoGebra. Here is the output for this data.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the data and the summary statistics.    From the list of summary statistics we can see that and inches. Now we can calculate the interquartile range.      This is the same value we found by hand. It is important to note that we are not using spreadsheets for the five-number summary because they do not calculate the quartiles in the same way, so they will not give the same results. Now that we have learned how to find the quartiles we can make a five-number summary and boxplot.    The Five-Number Summary and Boxplots  The five-number summary is made up of the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and the maximum. These five values divide the data into quarters. A boxplot , also called a box-and-whisker plot , is a graphical representation of the five-number summary. Each region of the boxplot contains approximately the same number of data values, so we can see the spread for each region. We can find the five-number summary and draw a boxplot by hand or by using GeoGebra. In our last example the five-number summary from GeoGebra is: 59, 62, 66, 68.5, 72 inches.   Five-Number Summary      We will use GeoGebra to find the five-number summary for the next example and then explain how to draw a boxplot.    Let's continue with the cost of textbook data from . Use GeoGebra to find the five-number summary for this sample and draw a boxplot by hand.  $140 $160 $160 $165 $180 $220 $235 $240 $250  $260 $280 $285 $285 $285 $290 $300 $300 $305  $310 $310 $315 $315 $320 $320 $330 $340 $345  $350 $355 $360 $360 $380 $395 $420 $460 $460    As we found before, here is the GeoGebra output. The last five entries of the summary statistics are the five-number summary. Remember to label all of your statistics with units.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the data and the summary statistics.    The five-number summary is     Min   Median   Max    $140  $255  $307.50  $347.50  $460     To draw the boxplot, we will first draw a number line that extends a little beyond the minimum and maximum values, and choose a scale. We decided to draw our number line from $120 to $480, in increments of $40. Then we add a meaningful title and units.  Next, make vertical lines at the first quartile, median and third quartile and connect them to form a box. This is the middle 50% of the data and you might notice that the width of the box is the IQR. Then, extend the whiskers out to the minimum and maximum values. Note that a boxplot does not have a vertical scale and the height of the box does not matter. Our boxplot looks like this:    A boxplot with a horizontal scale from $120 to $480 with a scale of $40.    GeoGebra will also draw boxplots for us. We enter and select the data values like we have done before and select One Variable Statistics. This brings up the graphics window with a histogram by default. Use the drop-down menu to select the boxplot. We also click on to show the summary statistics.      We will continue with our height data from the 12 people who identify as women. Find the five-number summary and create a boxplot using GeoGebra.    59 60 69 64 70 72 66 64 67 66 63 61  Following the steps above we have the following GeoGebra output. The last five entries in the statistics table are the five-number summary and we have the boxplot on the right.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showint the data, summary statistics and the boxplot.    Here is the five-number summary:     Min   Median   Max    59in  62in  65in  68in  72in     For this data, the two sides of the box and the two whiskers are approximately the same width. This suggests that the distribution is symmetric. We can verify this by noticing that the mean is approximately equal to the median.  The boxplot can tell us the shape of the distribution, but we cannot tell how many peaks the data has. For that we need a histogram. We can see the histogram and boxplot together by selecting the icon that looks like two rectangles stacked, or an = sign.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the histogram and boxplot stacked.    Now we have a full picture of this data.    The default boxplot in GeoGebra is called a modified box plot , which shows the data values that are outliers with an X but requires a few more steps to make by hand. To change from the modified box plot to a regular box plot, click on the left pointing arrow in the boxplot window (downloaded version) or the settings wheel (online version) for options, and uncheck “show outliers.” The output window below shows two side-by-side boxplots (the regular boxplot on top and the modified boxplot on the bottom) illustrating the distribution of the annual salaries for 50 randomly selected full-time workers in the Portland Metro area.    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing two boxplots for the same data stacked. The first one is the regular boxplot and show outliers is unchecked; the second one has 4 outliers on the right side and the box for show outliers is checked.    From the upper boxplot we can see that this distribution is skewed to the right and the upper quarter of the data is very spread out. It is natural to think of the data values as being evenly spread out in each region, but that is quite often not the case. From the lower boxplot we can see that there are 4 data values that are considered outliers and how far away the last data value is from the others. This is why it is useful to show outliers on a boxplot.    Modified Boxplot (Optional)  If you are curious to know how a modified boxplot is made, we will explain it briefly. There is a rule called the 1.5*IQR rule to determine which points are considered outliers. An outlier is a point that is more than 1.5 IQRs away from the middle 50% of the data (the box in the boxplot). We know how to calculate the IQR and then we multiply that by 1.5. We subtract that from Q1 to find the lower fence and add that value to Q3 to find the upper fence . Values beyond the fences are considered outliers and are drawn with an X or a star. Then we draw the whiskers of a modified box plot to the furthest data value inside the fence on each side.    Percentiles  Back when we were finding the median, we mentioned that the median is also called the 50th percentile, because 50% of the data values lie below it. We can define any percentile as the data value with that percentage of values below it. Since we have found the quartiles, we can also identify the 25th and 75th percentiles for our data. Q1 is the 25th percentile because 25% of the data values lie below it and Q3 is the 75th percentile because 75% of the data values lie below it.  Percentiles are used when comparing the growth of children to the population and in the results of standardized tests, such as the SAT test. If a person scored in the 83rd percentile, that means they scored higher than 83% of the people who took the test.    Comparing Distributions  Box plots and percentiles are particularly useful for comparing data from two populations.    The box plots of service times for two fast-food restaurants are shown below. Compare the length of time to get served at the two restaurants. Which one should you go to if you are in a hurry?      The boxplot for Store 1 shows a 5-number summary of 0.7, 1.8, 2.3, 2.9, 6.3 minutes. The boxplot for Store 2 shows a 5-number summary of 0.5, 1.1, 2.1, 5.7, 9.6 minutes.    Store 2 has a slightly shorter median service time (2.1 minutes vs. 2.3 minutes), but the service times are less consistent, with a wider spread of the data.  The 75th percentiles are 2.9 and 5.7 minutes. That means at store 1, 75% of customers were served within 2.9 minutes, while at store 2, 75% of customers were served within 5.7 minutes.  Which store should you go to in a hurry? That depends upon your opinion about luck – 25% of customers at store 2 had to wait between 5.7 and 9.6 minutes.      The boxplots below show the 5-number summaries of the birth weights, in kilograms, of infants with severe idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (SIRDS) van Vliet, P.K. and Gupta, J.M. (1973) Sodium bicarbonate in idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome. Arch. Disease in Childhood, 48, 249–255. As quoted on . The boxplots are separated to show the birth weights of infants who survived and those that did not. What can we conclude from this data?      The boxplot for infants who survived shows a 5-number summary of approximately 1.2, 1.8, 2.2, 2.9, 3.7 kg. The boxplot for infants who died shows a 5-number summary of 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 2.2, 2.8 kg.    Comparing the two groups, the boxplot reveals that the birth weights of the infants that died appear to be, overall, smaller than the weights of infants that survived. In fact, we can see that the median birth weight of infants that survived is about the same as the third quartile of the infants that died. Similarly, we can see that the 25th percentile of the survivors is larger than the 50th percentile of those that died, meaning that over 75% of the survivors had a birth weight larger than the median birth weight of those that died. Looking at the maximum value for those that died and the third quartile of the survivors, we can see that over 25% of the survivors had birth weights higher than the heaviest infant that died. The box plots give us a quick, though informal, way to determine that birth weight is quite likely linked to the survival of infants with SIRDS.      Z-Scores  Have you ever heard the saying that you can't compare apples and oranges? It turns out that you can - provided we standardize their measures first!  We will be using the standard score called a Z-score, which is a method commonly used with unimodal and symmetric distributions (called normal or nearly normal distributions ). Z-scores may be used with any data, but if the distribution is skewed, then the distribution of Z-scores will also be skewed.  To calculate the Z-score for a data value, we find out how far away from the mean it is by subtracting. Then we divide by the standard deviation to see how many standard deviations that is. Thus, the Z-score of a data value is the number of standard deviations it is away from the mean.   Z-score     Be sure to calculate the difference first, then divide   If a data value is above the mean, its Z-score will be positive. If a data value is below the mean, its Z-score will be negative. Therefore, if a data value is one standard deviation above the mean, its Z-score is +1. If it is 2.5 standard deviations below the mean, its Z-score is -2.5. Note that the units of Z-scores are standard deviations, not the units of the data values.  We can use Z-scores to determine the relative unusualness of a data value with respect to its own distribution. That is what allows us to compare two unlike items. The convention in statistics is to say that a data value is unusual if it is more than 2 standard deviations from the mean, or in other words, if its Z-score is less than -2 or greater than +2.   The oranges at a local grocery store have a mean diameter of 5.8 inches and a standard deviation of 1.2 inches. The apples, on the other hand, have a mean diameter of 4.2 inches and a standard deviation of 0.6 inches.  Ali closes their eyes and selects and apple and an orange. When they look at both pieces of fruit, they seem small. If the orange has a diameter of 4.2 inches and the apple has a diameter of 3.5 inches, which is smaller relative to their respective piles of fruit?  To determine which fruit is relatively smaller, Ali can find each of their Z-scores.     By convention, Z-scores are rounded to two decimal places, so we see that the orange is 1.33 standard deviations below its mean and the apple is 1.17 standard deviation below its mean. The orange is therefore smaller relative to its distribution since its Z-score is less than the apple's Z-score.  We can also see from the Z-scores that neither fruit has an unusually small diameter since each piece of fruit is less than 2 standard deviations from its mean.  We can also find Z-scores using a spreadsheet with this formula:   =STANDARDIZE(data value, mean, standard deviation)   To verify our apple and orange Z-scores, we would write:   Apple: =STANDARDIZE(4.2, 5.8, 1.2) and we get -1.33 standard deviations   a screenshot of a spreadsheet showing the =STANDARDIZE formula.     Orange: =STANDARDIZE (3.5, 4.2, 0.6) and we get -1.17 standard deviations   a screenshot of a spreadsheet showing the =STANDARDIZE formula.      The mean weight of men over the age of 20 is 195.7 pounds 2016 CDC Report. . The study included all ethnicities but the report does not say whether transgendered men were included. with a standard deviation of 29.8 pounds. The mean weight of domestic cats is 8.6 pounds with a standard deviation of 1.2 pounds. (The standard deviation for men's weights is estimated. The cat's mean weight is based on ideal cat weight and the standard deviation is approximate).  At his peak, Andre the Giant, the 7-foot-4-inch French professional wrestler and actor, weighed 520 pounds. When Georgie the cat was at his peak he weighed 24 pounds. Who was more giant – Andre the Giant or Georgie the cat?  Since the weights of cats and men cannot be compared directly, we will need to calculate the Z-scores.     Using the standardize function, we would write:   Andre: =STANDARDIZE (520, 197.5, 29.8) which gives us 10.88 standard deviations.  Georgie: =STANDARDIZE (24, 8.6, 1.2) which gives us 12.83 standard deviations.   Since both Z-scores are greater than 2 standard deviations, both weights are extremely unusual. However, since the Z-score for Georgie's weight is larger, he is even more giant than Andre the Giant.     Exercises    A group of diners were asked how much they would pay for a meal. Their responses were: $7.50, $25.00, $10.00, $10.00, $7.50, $8.25, $9.00, $5.00, $15.00, $8.00, $7.25, $7.50, $8.00, $7.00, $12.00.   Using your mean from , find the standard deviation of this data.

For Researcher 1, 50% of the patients live longer than 24 months after treatment, compared to 50% of patients living longer than 22 months after treatment for Researcher 1.  Researcher 2 has less variation in the life times than Researcher 1, with an IQR of 14 months for Researcher 2, compared to an IQR 16.5 months for Researcher 1.       The US Census Bureau, in addition to counting the population of the US every 10 years, conducts yearly informational surveys, such as the American Community Survey (ACS). For the 2012 ACS, a randomly chosen group of 20 respondents (10 males, 10 females) answered a question about their incomes.  Males: $53,000; $70,000; $12,800; 30,000; $4,500; $42,000; $48,000; $60,000; $108,000; $11,000  Females: $1,600; $1,200; $20,000; $25,000; $670; $29,000; $44,000; $30,000; $5,800; $50,000     Find the standard deviation of each group.    Calculate the 5-number summary for each group.    Calculate the range and IQR for each group.    Create side-by-side boxplots, and compare and contrast the two groups.         In GeoGebra:  In GeoGebra Classic, enter the data values for males into column A of the spreadsheet, and enter the data values for females into column B of the spreadsheet. Then use the Multiple Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics function to display the sample standard deviation for each set of data values.  The sample standard deviation for males is $31,530.66. The sample standard deviation for females $18,806.22.    In GeoGebra:  In GeoGebra Classic, enter the data values for males into column A of the spreadsheet, and enter the data values for females into column B of the spreadsheet. Then use the Multiple Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics function to display the sample standard deviation for each set of data values.  The 5-number summary for males is:     Min  Q1  Median  Q3  Max    $4,500  $12,800  $45,000  $60,000  $108,000     The 5-number summary for females is:     Min  Q1  Median  Q3  Max    $670  $1,600  $22,500  $30,000  $50,000       The range for males is:     The interquartile range (IQR) for males is:     The range for females is:     The interquartile range (IQR) for females is:           All of the values for the males' 5-number summary are larger than the corresponding values for the females' 5-number summary. The maximum income for males is more than twice the maximum income for females. Males have a significantly greater amount of variation in incomes than females, as shown by the larger range, IQR and standard deviation for males compared to females.       An experiment compared the ability of three groups of participants to remember briefly-presented chess positions. The data are shown below. The numbers represent the average number of pieces correctly remembered from three chess positions.   Find the standard deviation of each group.    Calculate the 5-number summary for each group.

However, tournaments players were not completely superior to the other two groups; the best non-players remembered more chess pieces than the worst tournament players. Also tournament players had more variation in how much they.       There is evidence that smiling can attenuate judgments of possible wrongdoing. This phenomenon termed the smile-leniency effect was the focus of a study by Marianne LaFrance & Marvin Hecht in 1995 LaFrance, M., & Hecht, M. A. (1995) Why smiles generate leniency. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21, 207-214. Adapted from , by David M. Lane, et al, used under CC-BY-SA 3.0 . . The following data are measurements of how lenient the sentences were for three different types of smiles and one neutral control. The same subject was used for all of the conditions so that may affect the results. The second column is a continuation of the first column.   Find the standard deviation for each type of smile and the neutral control.    Calculate the 5-number summary for type of smile and the neutral control.    Calculate the range and IQR for each type of smile and the neutral control.    Create side-by-side boxplots and compare and contrast the four groups.

The false smile seems to have been the most effective because the minimum, median, 3rd quartile, and maximum for the false group are greater than or equal to the corresponding values for any of the other groups.       Make up two data sets with 5 numbers each that have:   The same mean but different standard deviations.    The same standard deviation but different means.         There are many possible answers for this question. The data sets and have the same mean (10) but different standard deviations (0 and 1, respectively).    There are many possible answers for this question. The data sets and have the same standard deviation (0) but different means (2 and 9, respectively).       Make up two data sets with 7 numbers that each have:     The same IQR but different medians.    Different IQRs but the same medians.         There are many possible answers for this question. The data sets and have the same IQR (4) but different medians (4 and 14, respectively)    There are many possible answers for this question. The data sets and have the same median (14) but different IQRs (0 and 25, respectively).       The side-by-side boxplots show salaries for actuaries and CPAs.   Estimate the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles for CPA and actuary salaries.    Deshawn makes the median salary for an actuary. Kelsey makes the first quartile salary for a CPA. Who makes more money? How much more?    What percentage of actuaries make more than the median salary of a CPA?    What percentage of CPAs earn less than all actuaries?    The boxplot for CPA salary shows a 5-number summary of 30, 40, 75, 90, 100 in thousand dollars. The boxplot for Actuary salary shows a 5-number summary of 40, 75, 90, 94, 110 in thousand dollars           The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles are, respectively, the 1st quartile, median, and 3rd quartile for the data sets. Reading the boxplot for CPAs, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for CPAs' salaries are, respectively, $40,000, $75,000, and $90,000. Reading the boxplot for actuaries, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for actuaries' salaries are, respectively, $75,000, $90,000, and $94,000    Deshawn's salary (the median salary for an actuary) is $90,000; Kelsey's salary (the first quartile salary) is also $75,000. So Deshawn makes more than Kelsey, by $15,000.    75% of actuaries make more than the median salary of a CPA ($75,000).    25% of all CPAs earn less than all actuaries.       Fifty juniors and fifty seniors at a local high school were surveyed to find out how many hours per week they spend studying. The side-by-side boxplots the weekly study times for those high school juniors and seniors.    The boxplot of weekly study time for seniors shows a 5-number summary of 4, 5.5, 6, 9, 14 hours. The boxplot of weekly study time for juniors shows a 5-number summary of 0, 1, 3, 4, 6 hours       Estimate the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for weekly study time for high school juniors and seniors.    Olivia studies the maximum number of weekly study hours for a junior. Lucy studies the first quartile weekly study time for a senior. Who studies more, and by how many hours?    What percentage of juniors study between the minimum and median weekly study times for seniors?    What percentage of seniors study more than the third quartile weekly study time for juniors?         The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for weekly study times for the juniors are 1 hour, 3 hours, and 4 hours, respectively. The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles for weekly study times the seniors are 5.5 hours, 6 hours, and 9 hours.    Olivia studies more each week than Lucy, by 30 minutes.    50% of juniors study between the minimum and median number of hours for seniors.    100% of seniors study more than the third quartile weekly study time for juniors.       Suppose you buy a new car whose advertised gas mileage is 25 mpg (miles per gallon). After driving the car for several months, you find that you are getting only 21.4 mpg. You phone the manufacturer and learn that the standard deviation of gas mileage for cars of that model is 1.15 mpg.   Find the Z-score for the gas mileage of your car.    Does it appear that your car is getting unusually low gas mileage? Explain your answer using your Z-score.              The -score for the gas mileage of the car is -3.13 standard deviations.       According to a local marathon club, the mean finishing time for a marathon is 274 minutes, with a standard deviation of 63 minutes.     If I can run a marathon with a finishing time of 170 minutes, find the Z-score for my marathon time.    Is my marathon finishing time of 170 minutes unusually fast? Explain your answer using the Z-score.            The marathon time's -score is -1.65 standard deviations.    Because the marathon finishing time is within 2 standard deviations of the mean finishing time, no, this marathon finishing time is not usually fast.       This data is a sample of the average number of hours per year that a driver is delayed by road congestion in 11 cities: 56, 53, 53, 50, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 40, 36   Find the mean and the standard deviation, including units.    What is the Z-score for the city with an average delay time of 42 hours per year?         In GeoGebra:  In GeoGebra Classic, enter the data values into the column A of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option to find the mean and standard deviation.  The mean is 46.2 hours per year, and the standard deviation is 6.16 hours per year.       The -score for a city with an average delay time of 42 hours per year is -0.68 standard deviations.       In a survey of 12 companies recruiting for recent college graduates, they reported the following numbers of job applicants per job posting: 123, 123, 134, 127, 115, 122, 125, 101, 130, 143, 110, and 122.     Find the mean and standard deviation, including units.    What is the Z score for the company with 143 job applicants per job posting?         In GeoGebra:  In GeoGebra Classic, enter the data values into the column A of the spreadsheet and use the One Variable Analysis function. Then use the Show Statistics option to find the mean and standard deviation.  The mean is 122.9 job applicants per job posting, and the standard deviation is 10.91 job applicants per job posting.       The -score for a company with 143 job applicants per job posting is 1.84 standard deviations       You scored an 89 on a math test where the class mean and standard deviation are 75 points and 7 points respectively. You scored a 65 on an English test where the mean and standard deviation are 53 points and 4 points, respectively. In which class did you do better? Explain your answer using Z-scores.         Because the -score of my English test is greater than the -score of my math test, I did better on the English test than I did on the math test.    The mean running time for comedy movies is 139 minutes, with a standard deviation of 39.7 minutes. For action movies, the mean running time is 159 minutes, with a standard deviation of 26.2 minutes. A recent comedy movie had a running time of 102 minutes, while an action movie playing at the same theatre had a running time of 129 minutes. Which movie is shorter compared to other movies in the same genre? Explain your answer using Z-score.         Because the -score for the 129 minute action movie was less than the -score for the 102 comedy movie, the action movie was shorter than the comedy movie, when both movies are compared to other movies in their genres.    Poe, the Clydesdale horse has a world record breaking height of 20.2 hands. All Clydesdale horses have a mean height of 16.5 hands and a standard deviation of 1.85 hands. The last Great Dane to hold the world record for dog height was Gibson who was 107 cm tall. Great Danes have a mean height of 81 cm and a standard deviation of 13 cm. Which animal is taller compared to their respective breed? Explain your answer using Z-scores.         Because the -scores for the heights of Poe (the Clydesdale horse) and Gibson (the Great Dane) are the same, neither animal is taller than the other when compared to their respective breeds.    "

For the standard deviation we enter: =STDEV.S(A1:A36) and get $78.68.   The mean and the median are relatively close to each other, so we can expect the distribution to be approximately symmetric with maybe a slight skew to the left, since the mean is smaller.

We see that the mean is $299.58, the median is $307.50 and the sample standard deviation is $78.68 – just like we found using the spreadsheet formulas.  The statistics we will use are the sample size , the mean, median, and the sample standard deviation . The last five entries in the table – min, Q1, median, Q3, and max – together make up the 5-number summary which we will learn about shortly!    A screenshot of GeoGebra showing the data, histogram and summary statistics.    The standard deviation is the measure of variation that we pair with the mean for approximately symmetric distributions. This pairing should make sense because the standard deviation uses the mean in its calculation. But what about the median? What measure of variation do we pair with it?  "

We decided to draw our number line from $120 to $480, in increments of $40. Then we add a meaningful title and units.  Next, make vertical lines at the first quartile, median and third quartile and connect them to form a box. This is the middle 50% of the data and you might notice that the width of the box is the IQR. Then, extend the whiskers out to the minimum and maximum values. Note that a boxplot does not have a vertical scale and the height of the box does not matter. Our boxplot looks like this:    A boxplot with a horizontal scale from $120 to $480 with a scale of $40.    GeoGebra will also draw boxplots for us.

The boxplot for infants who survived shows a 5-number summary of approximately 1.2, 1.8, 2.2, 2.9, 3.7 kg. The boxplot for infants who died shows a 5-number summary of 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 2.2, 2.8 kg.    Comparing the two groups, the boxplot reveals that the birth weights of the infants that died appear to be, overall, smaller than the weights of infants that survived. In fact, we can see that the median birth weight of infants that survived is about the same as the third quartile of the infants that died. Similarly, we can see that the 25th percentile of the survivors is larger than the 50th percentile of those that died, meaning that over 75% of the survivors had a birth weight larger than the median birth weight of those that died. Looking at the maximum value for those that died and the third quartile of the survivors, we can see that over 25% of the survivors had birth weights higher than the heaviest infant that died. The box plots give us a quick, though informal, way to determine that birth weight is quite likely linked to the survival of infants with SIRDS.   "

When they look at both pieces of fruit, they seem small. If the orange has a diameter of 4.2 inches and the apple has a diameter of 3.5 inches, which is smaller relative to their respective piles of fruit?  To determine which fruit is relatively smaller, Ali can find each of their Z-scores.     By convention, Z-scores are rounded to two decimal places, so we see that the orange is 1.33 standard deviations below its mean and the apple is 1.17 standard deviation below its mean. The orange is therefore smaller relative to its distribution since its Z-score is less than the apple's Z-score.  We can also see from the Z-scores that neither fruit has an unusually small diameter since each piece of fruit is less than 2 standard deviations from its mean.  We can also find Z-scores using a spreadsheet with this formula:   =STANDARDIZE(data value, mean, standard deviation)   To verify our apple and orange Z-scores, we would write:   Apple: =STANDARDIZE(4.2, 5.8, 1.2) and we get -1.33 standard deviations   a screenshot of a spreadsheet showing the =STANDARDIZE formula.

The mean weight of domestic cats is 8.6 pounds with a standard deviation of 1.2 pounds. (The standard deviation for men's weights is estimated.

At his peak, Andre the Giant, the 7-foot-4-inch French professional wrestler and actor, weighed 520 pounds. When Georgie the cat was at his peak he weighed 24 pounds. Who was more giant – Andre the Giant or Georgie the cat?  Since the weights of cats and men cannot be compared directly, we will need to calculate the Z-scores.     Using the standardize function, we would write:   Andre: =STANDARDIZE (520, 197.5, 29.8) which gives us 10.88 standard deviations.  Georgie: =STANDARDIZE (24, 8.6, 1.2) which gives us 12.83 standard deviations.   Since both Z-scores are greater than 2 standard deviations, both weights are extremely unusual. However, since the Z-score for Georgie's weight is larger, he is even more giant than Andre the Giant.  "

Give the statistic for the percentage of students who use public transportation.         The population is PCC students and 73,000 is the sample size.    The sample is 250 students from the 4 main campuses.    Stratified Sample    Categorical or Qualitative            CNN conducted a survey of 500 American adults. 62% of those surveyed answered yes to the question, Do you favor a law to ban the sale of assault weapons and semiautomatic rifles?

Researchers select every 5th customer who walks into the store to take a survey.    Raffle tickets are distributed and collected in a bag, where they are mixed and ten are drawn for prizes.    I asked the shoppers near me in the shoe department what size they wear.    An IRS auditor randomly selects 25 taxpayers in each filing status (single, head of household, married filing jointly, and married filing separately).         Systematic    Simple Random Sample    Convenience    Systematic       Identify the most relevant source of bias in each situation.     An opinion poll is posted on Facebook and Twitter asking how you are most likely to vote for in the next election.    Keller Auditorium ask all the people in the front three rows if they enjoyed the Broadway play.    To determine opinions on voter support for a downtown farmers market, a surveyor randomly questions people working close to the park where the farmers market would be.    A survey asks people to report the number of hours they work out each week.    A survey randomly calls people on their landlines and ask them if they would support a school bond measure in the next election.         Voluntary Response Bias    Sampling Bias    Sampling Bias    Response bias    Perceived lack of anonymity       Identify whether each situation describes an observational study or an experiment. If it is an experiment.     Subjects are asked to run a mile and record their time.    Fifty students were asked to go to a quiet space in the library to memorize a poem. Fifty students were asked to go to a noisy location in the cafeteria to memorize the poem. Each student recorded how much time it took to memorize the poem.         Observational    Experiment       For the clinical trial of a migraine drug, subjects were randomly divided into two groups. The first received an inert pill, while the second received the test medicine. Patients were not aware of which group they were in. After one month, patients reported how many migraines they experienced.     Which is the treatment group?    Which is the control group (if there is one)?    Is this study blind, double-blind, or neither?    Is this best described as an experiment, a controlled experiment, or a placebo-controlled experiment?         The treatment group is the group receiving the test medicine for migraines.    The control group is the group receiving the inert pill.    This is a blind study.    This is a placebo-controlled experiment.       In a recent study , 380 high risk adolescents involved in the juvenile justice system were recruited to test an app designed to increase mindfulness and reduce substance use. Participants were randomly and equally assigned to use the app (Rewire) or receive services as usual from the Department of Youth Services. Participants were assessed to determine a baseline for substance use at the beginning of the study, and were asked to complete follow up assessments after 1 and 3 months. Assessments consisted of online surveys asking about substance use, emotion regulation, family demographics, and mindfulness practices. Urine samples were collected at each interview to verify self-reported substance use.     Describe the treatment group.    Describe the control group (if there is one).    Is this study blind, double-blind, or neither? Explain    Is this best described as an experiment, a controlled experiment, or a placebo-controlled experiment?         The treatment group is the group assigned to use the Rewire app.    The control group is the group that receives the usual services from the Department of Youth Services.    This study is neither blind nor double-blind because the researchers and the youth know whether they are using the Rewire app of receiving the usual services from the Department of Youth Services.    This is a controlled experiment.       In a 2010 survey, US teens aged 12-18 were asked what their favorite movie genre was. The results are shown below.   Action: 351    Adventure: 171    Comedy: 651    Drama: 389    Horror: 287    Romance: 107    Undecided: 51        What is the implied population?    How many people were sampled?    What type of data is this?    Create a relative frequency bar chart of the results.    Create a pie chart of the results.    Explain the advantages\/disadvantages of the two charts.    What is the statistic for the percentage of teens whose favorite movie genre is horror?         The implied population is United States teenagers.    There were 2007 teens surveyed.    Qualitative or Categorical                  Answers will vary    About 14.3% of teens chose horror as their favorite movie genre.       A survey of 5325 Portland residents was conducted to determine the primary purpose of using TriMet. The results are shown below.    A bar graph with the following categories and percentages: recreation 45%, work 17%, personal business 8%, shopping 7%, school 6%, medical 3%, visit 3% and other 1%       How many people use TriMet for personal business?    How many people use TriMet to get to the airport?         426 people use TriMet for personal business.     479 people people use TriMet to get to the airport.        A group of college students were asked what the price of gas would need to be before they would start using public transportation to get to school instead of driving. Their responses in $\/gallon are listed below:  5.25, 5.00, 4.25, 3.75, 5.00, 4.50, 3.95, 3.75, 5.75, 4.75, 3.25, 3.75, 4.75, 5.00, 8.95     Find the mean and median. Round to two decimal places and include units.    Based on the mean and median, would you expect the distribution to be symmetric, skewed left, or skewed right? Explain.    Find the standard deviation. Round to two decimal places and include units.    Calculate the z-scores for the responses of $3.25 and $8.95. Are either of these values unusual?    Determine the 5-number summary for the data.    What is the range and IQR of the data set? Round to two decimal places and include units.    Use the 5-number summary to construct a box plot.         The mean is $4.78. The median is $4.75.    The mean and median is about the same value therefore the data is symmetric.    The standard deviation is $1.34.                                     The following is a sample of scores from a recent Math 105 exam:  32, 71, 72, 73, 73, 73, 76, 77, 78, 78, 79, 86, 88, 88, 88, 94, 94, 99     Find the mean of the data. Round to one decimal place if necessary.    Find the median of the data. Round to one decimal place if necessary.    Just comparing the mean and the median, do you expect the distribution to be skewed left, skewed right, or symmetric. Explain.    Find the standard deviation of the data. Round to one decimal place if needed.    Explain what the mean and standard deviation tell you about the sampled test scores.    Is the score of 99 unusual? Use z-scores to support your claim.    Find the 5-number summary.    Use the 5-number summary to create a box plot.    Create a histogram of the data. Start your scale at 0, and use a bin size of 10.    Describe the shape of the distribution. Be sure to address all three characteristics (modality, symmetry, and outliers).         The mean is about 78.9.    The median is 78.    The mean is greater than the median therefore the data is left skewed.    The standard deviation is about 14.5.    The majority of values are between 64.4 and 93.4.     . This 99 is only 1.39 standard deviations above the mean. This is not unusual. Generally, a value should be more than three deviations above or below the mean to be considered unusual.                            The following table shows the cost of purchasing a car at a local dealership. Some of the cars sold were new and some were used.     Cost (Thousands of dollars)  Frequency    12  6    15  7    18  12    22  10    30  12    32  11    40  6    45  6        Find the mean and standard deviation of the data. Round to two decimal places and include units.    Explain what standard deviation tell you about how much cars are selling for at this dealership.    Determine the five-number summary.    What is the range and IQR?    Use the five-number summary to construct a boxplot of the data.         The mean is about $26,200 and the standard deviation is about $10,000.    The majority of cars sell for between $16,200 and $36,200.                             The double box-and-whisker plot Source: shows the goals scored per game by two soccer teams during a 25 game season.    The boxplot for Team A shows a 5-number summary of 0, 2, 4, 5, 8 goals. The boxplot for Team B shows a 5-number summary of 0, 6, 8, 9, 10 goals.       Estimate the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles for Team A and Team B goals.    What is the median number of goals for Team A? Team B?    What percentage of the goals for Team B is more than the maximum number of Team A?    What Team data is more symmetric?    What is the shape of the distribution for Team B?         The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile for Team A goals are 2, 4, and 5, respectively.  The 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile for Team B goals are 6, 8, and 9, respectively.    The Median for Team A is 4.  The Median for Team B is 8.    Fifty percent of the goals for Team B exceed the maximum number for goals for Team A.    The data for Team A is more symmetric than for Team B.    The data for Team B is skewed left.       Suppose you buy a new car whose advertised gas mileage is 35 mpg (miles per gallon). After driving the car for several months, you find that you are getting only 30.4 mpg. You phone the manufacturer and learn that the standard deviation for that model is 1.35 mpg.     Find the z-score for the gas mileage of your car.    Does it appear that your car is getting unusually low gas mileage? Explain your answer using your z-score.              30.4 mpg is 3.41 standard deviations below the mean so the car is getting unusually low gas mileage.       This data is a sample of the average number of minutes per week that a driver is delayed by road congestion in 13 cities:  66, 55, 53, 50, 36, 45, 34, 43, 52, 40, 76, 45, 63     Find the mean and the standard deviation, including units.    What is the z-score for the city with an average delay time of 42 hours per week?    Is an average delay time of 42 hours per week unusual? Explain using the calculated z-score.         The mean is approximately 50.6 minutes per week. The standard deviation approximately 12.2 minutes per week.         42 minutes per week is 0.70 standard deviations below the mean, so it is not unusual.      "

  "body": " The Normal Distribution   The Normal Distribution   Students will be able to:     Explain the properties of the Normal distribution    Calculate probabilities using the Empirical Rule    Calculate probabilities using technology    Calculate and interpret Z-scores    Calculate and interpret the bounds of a 95% confidence interval given the point estimate and the standard error       Alternative Video Lessons      Introduction to The Normal Distribution  There is a pattern or shape that comes up frequently when graphing data called the Normal distribution . You might be familiar with it as the bell curve . When we take measurements like the lengths of newborn babies or the weights of potato chip bags on an assembly line there are usually more measurements near the mean and fewer as we get further away from the mean on each side. We often see histograms with this shape:    A histogram where the bars form a bell shape. A Normal curve is overlaid on the histogram.    Notice how the shape is unimodal and symmetric with larger and smaller values getting less and less common as they get further from the mean. When we take samples from a population we might not get an exact Normal distribution but it is often close. We call this approximately Normal or nearly Normally distributed. The curve drawn over the histogram shows that the data are nearly Normal. Earlier in this chapter we learned about the mean , median and mode as measures of center and the standard deviation as a measure of variation or spread. The mean is often written with the greek letter mu, . The standard deviation is usualy represented by the lowercase Greek letter sigma, .    Properties of the Normal Distribution  Regardless of the data values, the Normal distribution has these properties:   The shape is unimodal and symmetric around the center.    The mean, median and mode are approximately the same value in the center.    Due to the symmetry, approximately 50% of the data values are below the mean, and approximately 50% of the data values are above the mean.    A normal curve with a line drawn in the middle to indicate the mean, median and mode. The drawing shows that 50% of the data values are below the line and 50% are above the line.      Almost all of the area under a Normal curve is within 3 standard deviations of the mean, so we use the standard deviation as our scale.    Data within two standard deviations of the mean are considered typical or usual. Data beyond two standard deviation are considered unusual. Data beyond 3 standard deviations are considered rare.     Now let's look at an example where we draw and label a Normal distribution given the mean and standard deviation All of the Normal drawings in this section were created with the online probability calculator at which is in the public domain. .   The test scores on a math quiz are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation of 4 points. Draw the Normal distribution and label the axis using the standard deviation.    A normal curve with the mean of 18 points labeled in the middle. To the right, 3 standard deviations are labeled 22, 26 and 30 points. To the left 3 standard deviations are labeled 14, 10 and 6 points.    We start by drawing a Normal curve and the horizontal axis. Then we place the mean of 18 points in the center of the graph and make 3 marks on each side, ending where the curve gets close to the axis.  Each mark represents one standard deviation. As we move to the right of the mean we will add the standard deviation of 4 points to get 22, 26 and 30 points. These are the values that are 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations above the mean.     Then we move to the left of the mean we subtract the standard deviation of 4 from 18 to get 14, 10 and 6 points. These are the values that are 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations below the mean.        The Empirical Rule  No matter what the mean and standard deviation are for a Normal Distribution, they always have the same shape or distribution of the data. We can describe this with the Empirical Rule which is also called the 68-95-99.7 Rule .  The numbers in the 68-95-99.7 rule describe the percentage of data or area within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean. Let's look at our previous example with scores on a math quiz that are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation of 4 points.   According to the Empirical rule, about 68% of all the data values fall within one standard deviation of the mean, or between 14 and 22 points.   A graph of a normal curve that shows 68% of the data values shaded within one standard deviation of the mean, in this case between 14 and 22 points.     About 95% of all the data values fall within two standard deviation, or between 10 and 26 points.   A graph of a normal curve that shows 95% of the data values shaded within two standard deviations of the mean, in this case between 10 and 26 points.     About 99.7% of all the data values fall within three standard deviations, or between 6 and 30 points.   A graph of a normal curve that show 99.7% of the data values shaded within 3 standard deviations of the mean, in this case between 6 and 30 points.    Now you can try this next example:    The weights of black lab dogs are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 78 pounds and a standard deviation of 7 pounds.   Draw and label a sketch of this distribution.    Use the Empirical Rule to complete following statements.   Approximately 68% of black labs weigh between and pounds.    Approximately 95% of black lab dogs weigh between and pounds.    Approximately 99.7% of black lab dogs weigh between and pounds.             We start by drawing the Normal curve and the horizontal axis, labeling 3 standard deviations on each side.   A normal curve labeled with 57, 64, 71, 78, 85, 92 and 99 pounds. The title of the graph is weights of black lab dogs in points.        Approximately 68% of black labs weigh between 71 and 85 pounds.    Approximately 95% of black labs weigh between 64 and 92 pounds.    Approximately 99.7% of black labs weigh between 57 and 99 points.            Using the Empirical Rule to Calculate Approximate Probabilities  Now that we have learned about the Empirical rule we can use it to find approximate probabilities. First we will calculate the percentage in each segment of the Normal distribution. Returning to our example of quiz scores with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation of 4 points, we can divide the curve into segments by drawing a line at each standard deviation.    A normal curve labeled with 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26 and 30 points. The title is quiz scores in points. There is a line segment at each number listed to divide the curve into segments.    Now, since we know that approximately 68% of the values are between 14 and 22 points, and the graph is symmetric, we divide 68% by 2 to get: So each of the middle 2 segments are 34% of the area each.  Next, we know that 95% of the values fall within 2 standard deviations or between 10 and 26 points. That also includes the 68% though, so to get the area of the next two segments, we subtract: Then since there is one segment on each side, we divide that by 2: So the next two segments from the mean are 13.5% each.  Continuing outward, 99.7% of the values fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean or between 6 and 30 points. Since that includes the 95% we subtract: Then we divide that by 2: So the next two segments outward are 2.35% each.  Finally, there is one more set, since there is a tiny percentage outside of the 3 standard deviations. The total is 100% so we subtract: Then we divide that by 2: So the last two outer segments are 0.15% each.  We can summarize all the calculations in this drawing:    The previous normal curve with the area of each segment filled in. From left to right the areas are 0.15%, 2.35%, 13.5%, 34%, 34%, 13.5%, 2.35%, 0.15%.    Now let's continue our quiz score example to see how to use the Empirical Rule to find probabilities.   For the quiz score data that are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation 4 points, use the 68-95-99.7% rule to calculate the following probabilities:     What percentage of students earned scores between 22 and 30 points?    What percentage of students earned scores above 14 points?    What percentage of students earned a score below 14 or above 22 points?     Solution   Using the diagram above, we add the two segments between 22 and 30 to get . 15.8% percent of students earned scores between 22 and 30 points on the quiz.    We add all the segments above 14 to get . 84% of students earned scores above 14 points on the quiz.    We add all the segments below 14 and above 22 to get . 32% of students earned scores below 14 or above 22 points on the quiz. Notice we could have done this in a faster way by taking . There can be more than one way to get the answer.      Now you can try one with this next example.    Continuing with the black lab dogs whose weights are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 78 pounds and a standard deviation 7 pounds, use the 68-95-99.7% rule to calculate the following probabilities:     What percentage of black labs weigh between 78 and 92 pounds?    What percentage of black labs weigh below 71 points?    What percentage of black labs weigh below 64 or above 78 points?       First we need to draw this distribution and label three standard deviations on each side of the mean to determine where these weights fall. That will tell us which segments to add up. Here is our drawing of this distribution from before.   The previous normal curve of weights of black lab dogs in pounds. The scale at the bottom is 57, 64, 71, 78, 85, 92, 99 pounds.      Using this Normal curve along with the diagram above we see we need to add the two segments between 78 and 92 pounds to get . 47.5% percent of black labs weigh between 78 and 92 pounds.    We add all the segments below 71 pounds to get . 16% of black labs weigh below 71 pounds.    We add all the segments below 64 and above 78 pounds to get . 52.5% of black labs weigh below 64 or above 78 pounds. Notice we could have done this in a faster way since 78 is the mean we know the percentage above the mean is 50%. We could have added .         Using Technology to Calculate Exact Probabilities  The Empirical rule is used to find approximate probabilities and it only works if the number is one of the labels on our scale. We usually want to calculate an exact answer with any value. We will use technology to calculate probabilities with two different methods: Onlinestatbook.com and spreadsheets . Check with your class notes or instructor on which technology to use.   To use Onlinestatbook.com, go to the OnlineStatbook Normal calculator and enter the mean and standard deviation. Then select the option that matches the probability you want to find: Above, Below, Between or Outside and enter the probability you want to find. Then click on the Recalculate button.   A screenshot of the onlinestatbook.com normal probability calculator. It shows a normal curve, an input box for the mean and median, and a choice to find above, below, between or outside.    To use a spreadsheet, we will use the spreadsheet formula   =NORM.DIST(value, mean, standard deviation, cumulative)   This function always gives the probability to the left of a number or . We can use this formula to find greater than, between and outside probabilities as well. Here are the commands we will use and we will explain them in the next example with visuals.     Probability  Spreadsheet Formula    Below  =NORM.DIST(value, mean, SD, 1)    Above  =1-NORM.DIST(value, mean, SD,1)    Between  =NORM.DIST(upper_value, mean, SD, 1)-Norm.Dist(lower_value, mean, SD, 1)    Outside  =NORM.DIST(lower_value, mean, SD, 1)+1-NORM.DIST(upper_value,mean, SD, 1)      For the quiz score data that are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation 4 points, use technology to calculate the following probabilities:     What percentage of students earned a score below 12 points?    What percentage of students earned scores above 27 points?    What percentage of students earned scores between 21 and 25 points?    What percentage of students earned scores less than 11 or more than 23?     Solution     First, using OnlineStatbook, we we will enter the mean of 18 points and the standard deviation of 4 points. Then we select Below and enter 12. This gives us a result of as shown in the image or .  To use a spreadsheet, we enter =NORM.DIST(12, 18, 4, 1) . The last value is always a 1 to indicate that we want a cumulative probability or area. This also gives us a result of or .    A screenshot of onlinestatbook showing the inputs and output described above.        To use OnlineStatbook, we we will keep our mean of 18 points and standard deviation of 4 points. Then we select Above and enter 27. This gives us a result of as shown in the image or .  To use a spreadsheet, NORM.DIST gives us the area to the left so if we want the area to the right we need to find the complement or subtract from 1. We enter =1-NORM.DIST(27, 18, 4, 1) . This also gives us a result of or .    A screenshot of onlinestatbook showing the inputs and output described above.       To use OnlineStatbook, we we will keep our mean of 18 points and standard deviation of 4 points. Then we select Between and enter 21 and 25. This gives us a result of as shown in the image or .   A screenshot of onlinestatbook showing the inputs and output described above.    To use a spreadsheet, we need to use NORM.DIST twice. We can find the area to the left of the upper value and then subtract the area to the left of the lower value. That will give us the area between the two values. We enter =NORM.DIST(25, 18, 4, 1)-NORM.DIST(21, 18, 4, 1) . This also gives us a result of or .     To use OnlineStatbook, we we will keep our mean of 18 points and standard deviation of 4 points. Then we select Outside and enter 11 and 23. This gives us a result of as shown in the image or .   A screenshot of onlinestatbook showing the inputs and output described above.    To use a spreadsheet, we will find the left and right probabilities and add them together. We enter =NORM.DIST(11, 18, 4, 1)+1-NORM.DIST(23, 18, 4, 1) . This also gives us a result of or .      Now you can this try this example.    Continuing with the black lab dogs whose weights are approximately normally distributed with a mean of 78 pounds and a standard deviation 7 pounds, use technology to calculate the following probabilities:     The probability that a randomly chosen black lab weighs at least 95 pounds.    The probability that a randomly chosen black lab weighs less than 72 pounds.    The probability that a black lab weighs less than 65 pounds or greater than 86 pounds.    The probability that a black lab weighs between 66 and 75.          Using OnlineStatbook and\/or =1-NORM.DIST(95, 78, 7, 1) we get or .    Using OnlineStatbook and\/or =NORM.DIST(72, 78, 7, 1) we get or .    Using OnlineStatbook and\/or =NORM.DIST(65, 78, 7, 1)+1-NORM.DIST(86, 78, 7, 1) we get or .    Using OnlineStatbook and\/or =NORM.DIST(75, 78, 7, 1)-NORM.DIST(66, 78, 7, 1) we get or .         The Standard Normal Distribution and Z-Scores  Earlier in the chapter we learned how to calculate a Z-score , which is a way to determine how usual or unusual a data value is, or compare values from two different distributions. To calculate the Z-score for a data value, we calculate its distance from the mean. Then we divide that distance by the standard deviation to see how many standard deviations that is. Thus, the Z-score of a data value is the number of standard deviations it is away from the mean.   Z-score     Be sure to calculate the difference first, then divide.   If a data value is equal to the mean it will have a Z-score of 0. If a data value is one standard deviation above the mean, it will have a Z-score of 1. We can make a Normal distribution of Z-scores and it will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is called the Standard Normal distribution , shown below.    A normal curve labeled with -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 standard deviations. The title is Z-scores. There is a line at each number dividing the curve into segments.    Applying the Empirical Rule in percentage form to the Standard Normal curve looks like this.    The previous normal curve with the area of each segment filled in. From left to right the areas are 0.15%, 2.35%, 13.5%, 34%, 34%, 13.5%, 2.35%, 0.15%.    Sometimes we may want to use the decimal form of the numbers instead.    The previous normal curve with the area of each segment filled in in decimal form. From left to right the areas are 0.0015, 0.0235, 0.135, 0.34, 0.34, 0.135, 0.0235, 0.0015.    Applying the Empirical Rule to the Standard Normal distribution, we know that 68% of all Z-scores will be between -1 and 1, 95% of all Z-scores will be between -2 and 2 and 99.7% of all Z-scores will be between -3 and 3. A Z-score below -3 or above 3 is possible, but is very unlikely.   Let's say a student scored 27 points on the math quiz where the scores were approximately normally distributed with a mean of 18 points and a standard deviation of 4 points. We know from our earlier drawing that they scored between 2 and 3 standard deviations above the mean. Let's calculate the Z-score to determine exactly how many standard deviations from the mean they scored.  First we take the data value and subtract the mean of 18, then we divide by the standard deviation of 4 points: . The Z-score is positive so which confirms that they scored above the mean.     Now you can calculate the Z-score for a student who scored 15 on the math quiz.    First we take the data value and subtract the mean of 18, then we divide by the standard deviation of 4 points: . This student scored 0.75 standard deviations below the mean. The Z-score is negative which means they scored below the mean.      Confidence Intervals and Margin of Error  Now that we have learned more about the Normal distribution, we can come back to confidence intervals which we studied in section 3.1. When we take a sample, our goal is to infer our statistic to the larger population. Let's say we wanted to know the average height of all 10-year-old kids living in the United States. It would take too much time and money to measure them all so we take a random sample that is representative of the population of 10-year-olds.  If we measured 25 randomly selected 10-year-olds and calculated the sample mean of 54.5 inches, that statistic is called a point estimate . It is a single value that we got from a sample. However, if we measured another random sample of 25 different kids we would likely get a different mean. That is called sampling variation or sampling error. To be more accurate in our estimation of the height of all 10-year olds we give a range of values called a confidence interval .  To construct a confidence interval we need to know the point estimate, the standard error of the data and the desired confidence level. The standard error is an estimate for the standard deviation that we calculate from the sample data and the sample size. You can learn more details about sampling distributions, why they are Normally distributed and how to calculate the standard error in a statistics course.  The most common confidence level is the 95% confidence level. The 95% confidence interval represents the middle 95% of the Normal curve. From the Empirical rule we saw that approximately 95% of the data values are within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Using more exact methods, the middle 95% is 1.96 standard deviations from the mean.    A normal curve showing the middle 95% of the area shaded, which is 1.96 standard deviations on each side of the mean of 0.    Let's say that our point estimate for the height of 10-year-olds is 54.5 inches and the standard error is 1.75 inches. To estimate the middle 95% of values we multiply the standard error by 1.96 standard deviations.     To find the lower boundary of the confidence interval we subtract   To find the upper boundary of the confidence interval add .  The 95% confidence interval is 51.07 to 57.93 inches or (51.07, 57.93) inches.  To interpret a confidence interval we say: We are 95% confident that the true average height of all 10-year-olds is between 51.07 and 57.93 inches. This means if repeated samples were taken and the 95% confidence interval was computed for each sample, about 95% of the intervals would contain the true population mean. About five percent of the intervals would not contain the population mean.  The standard error multiplied by the number of standard deviations for the confidence level is called the margin of error . In this example we have  . The margin of error is the range of values below and above your sample mean in the confidence interval.  Since the point estimate is our best guess for the value of the parameter, it makes sense to build the confidence interval around that value. The standard error, which is the measure of the uncertainty associated with the point estimate, provides a guide for how large we should make the confidence interval. When the sampling distribution of a point estimate can reasonably be modeled as Normal, the point estimate we observe will be within 1.96 standard errors of the true value of interest. We can be 95% confident this interval captures the true value.  The idea behind confidence intervals and margin of error is that any survey, study or poll will always be different from the population because samples vary. The confidence interval and margin of error reflect the sample size and the variation in the sample.    Exercises   Describe the shape of a Normal distribution.   The shape of a Normal distribution is unimodal, symmetric and bell-shaped.    In a Normal distribution, what percentage of observations will lie to the left of the mean?   50% of the observations will be below the mean.    If the diameters of trees in a forest follow a nearly Normal distribution has a mean of 35 inches and a standard deviation of 15 inches. What is the median width?   The median tree diameter is approximately 35 inches.    Two Normal distributions have the same means but different standard deviations. Distribution A has a standard deviation of 10 inches, and distribution B has a standard deviation of 15 inches. Which curve has a wider spread along the horizontal axis? Why?   Distribution B has a wider spread because it has a larger standard deviation.     Use the Empirical Rule to answer these questions.    About what percentage of the values from a Normal distribution fall within one standard deviation (left and right) of the mean?   Approximately 68% of the values fall within one standard deviation of the mean.    About what percentage of the values from a Normal distribution fall within two standard deviations (left and right) of the mean?   Approximately 95% of the values fall within two standard deviations of the mean.    About what percentage of the values from a Normal distribution fall within three standard deviations (left and right) of the mean?   Approximately 99.7% of the values fall within three standard deviations of the mean.    About what percentage of the values from a Normal distribution fall outside of three standard deviations (left and right) of the mean?   Approximately 0.3% of the values fall outside of three standard deviations of the mean.    About what percentage of the values from a Normal distribution fall between the first and second standard deviations from the mean (both sides)?   Approximately 27% of the values fall between the first and second standard deviations from the mean.    About what percentage of the values from a Normal distribution fall between the first and third standard deviations (both sides)?   Approximately 31.7% of the values fall between the first and third standard deviations from the mean.    About what percentage of values from a Normal distribution fall between the second and third standard deviations (on both sides)?   Approximately 4.7% of the values fall between the second and third standard deviations from the mean.    About what percentage of values from a Normal distribution fall outside the first standard deviation from the mean (on both sides)?   Approximately 32% of the values fall outside the first standard deviation from the mean.    About what percent of values in a Normal distribution fall between the mean and one standard deviation below the mean?   Approximately 34% of the values fall between the mean and one standard deviation below the mean.    About what percent of values in a Normal distribution fall between the mean and three standard deviations above the mean?   Approximately 49.85% of the values fall between the mean and three standard deviations above the mean.

To illustrate the data, we made a frequency table and used it to create a pie chart or bar chart. But what if we want to illustrate the relationship between two categorical variables? To do this, we can use a contingency table.    Contingency Tables  A contingency table summarizes all the possible combinations for two categorical variables. Each value in the table represents the number of times a particular combination of outcomes occurs. For example, suppose we randomly select 250 households from the greater Portland area and ask whether they have a cat and whether they have a dog. In this case, have a cat and have a dog are the two variables, and each variable has two categories: Yes and No. To create the contingency table, we make columns for the categories of one variable, and rows for the categories of the other variable. We also add a row and column for the subtotals of each category. Each cell of the resulting table contains the number of outcomes having the characteristics of the intersecting row and column categories. For our dog and cat example, the table would look like this:      Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  Yes Cat and Yes Dog  Yes Cat and No Dog  Yes Cat Total    No Cat  No Cat and Yes Dog  No Cat and No Dog  No Cat Total    Total  Yes Dog Total  No Dog Total  Grand total     Suppose that of the 250 households surveyed, 180 said they have a cat, 95 said they have a dog, and 52 said they have both a cat and a dog. We can use this information to fill in the cells of the table.      Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52   180    No Cat       Total  95   250     The first cell we can fill in is the grand total , which is the total number of subjects in the study. In this case, there are 250 households participating in the survey. The next two cells we can fill in are the total number of households that have a cat, 180, and the total number of households that have a dog, 95. The final cell we can fill in from the given information is the intersection of the having a dog column and a having a cat row, which is 52 households.  Since each row and column must sum to their totals, we can use subtraction to find the missing numbers as shown below.      Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52   180    No Cat   or     Total  95   250     Now that we have our contingency table completed, notice that the numbers in the central four cells add to the grand total as shown in the table on the left. The total row and the total column also add to the grand total as shown in the right table.      Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52  128  180    No Cat  43  27  70    Total  95  155  250       Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52  128  180    No Cat  43  27  70    Total  95  155  250       Contingency Tables and Venn Diagrams  If the subtractions we just did seem familiar, they should! This is very similar to what we did for reporting data with a Venn diagram. The Venn diagram for this data is shown below. We also subtracted the intersection from the total of the cat and dog owners to find numbers in the crescent regions.  Notice that the numbers in the four regions of the Venn diagram are the same as the four cells in the center of the contingency table and add to the grand total.    A Venn diagram with two overlapping circles and a box around it. The Cat only region shows 180-52=128; The dog only region shows 95-52=43; the interesection is 52 and the number outside the circles in the universal set is 27.      And Statements  Now we can use the contingency table or the Venn diagram to determine the percentage of households that meet certain conditions. For instance, what percent of those surveyed own a cat and do not own a dog? In the Venn diagram, this is 128 households in the cat only region.  In the contingency table we see the 128 households at the intersection of the row of households who own a cat and the column of households who do not own a dog. As a percentage, the total number of households surveyed, is or 51.2% that have a cat and no dog.      Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52  128  180    No Cat  43  27  70    Total  95  155  250       Or Statements  How about the percentage of households surveyed that have a cat or a dog? We know from Venn diagrams that the inclusive or includes the number of households who own a cat only, a dog only, and both a cat and a dog, or households. As a percentage of the total surveyed, we get or 89.2% of households in the sample have a dog or a cat (or both).  We can get the same answer from the contingency table. by adding the cells for households who have a cat and not a dog, a dog and not a cat, and the households that have both a cat and a dog. This also gives us 223 households.  There is another way to calculate an or statements from a contingency table. We could add the row and column totals for having a cat and having a dog, but then we have counted the 52 households in the intersection twice. We can subtract that number to get households with a dog or a cat, which we know is 89.2% of those surveyed.      Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52  128  180    No Cat  43  27  70    Total  95  155  250       Conditional Statements  Another question we can answer using a contingency table is what percentage of dog owning households also own a cat? In this case the group that we are interested in isn't every household surveyed (the grand total), but just those households that own a dog.      Dog  No Dog  Total    Cat  52  128  180    No Cat  43  27  70    Total  95  155  250     We call this a conditional statement because we are only considering the households with a certain condition. If we focus on the column representing the households that own a dog, we see that there is a total of 95 households with a dog, and that 52 of those 95 households also have a cat. Therefore, or approximately 54.7% of the households with a dog also have a cat. Another way to phrase this conditional statement is, What percent of households have a cat given they have a dog. You will see the word given quite a bit in this chapter and that makes the denominator change. It is also possible to find this conditional percentage using the Venn diagram by taking the number in the intersection and dividing it by the total in the whole dog circle.    Contingency Tables with More Than Two Categories  When there are only two categories for each variable, like yes\/no questions, Venn diagrams and contingency tables provide basically the same information and can be used interchangeably. A Venn diagram works well for yes\/no variables since a subject is either inside the circle (has the characteristic) or outside the circle (does not have the characteristic). If we have more than two possibilities for any of the variables, though, we cannot use a Venn diagram. We can use a contingency table, though. Here is an example where one variable has four categories and the other has three categories.    910 randomly sampled registered voters from Tampa, FL were asked if they thought workers who have illegally entered the US should (i) be allowed to keep their jobs and apply for US citizenship, (ii) be allowed to keep their jobs as temporary guest workers but not be allowed to apply for US citizenship, or (iii) lose their jobs and have to leave the country. Not sure was also an option (iv). The results of the survey by political ideology are shown below SurveyUSA, News Poll #18927 , data collected Jan 27-29, 2012. Example adapted from Open Intro: Advanced High School Statistics , by Diez et al, used under CC-BY-SA 3.0 . . Use the contingency table to answer the questions.      Conservative  Moderate  Liberal  Total    (i) Apply for citizenship  57  120  101  278    (ii) Guest worker  121  113  28  262    (iii) Leave the country  179  126  45  350    (iv) Not sure  15  4  1  20    Total  372  363  175  910        What percent of the sampled Tampa, Fl voters identified themselves as conservatives?    What percent of the sampled voters are in favor of the citizenship option?    What percent of the sampled voters identify themselves as conservatives and are in favor of the citizenship option?    What percent of the sampled voters identify themselves as liberal or are in favor of the leaving the country option?    What percent of the sampled voters who identify as conservatives are also in favor of the citizenship option? What percent of moderate and liberal voters share this view?          To answer this question, we find the conservative column and look to the bottom cell for the total number of conservative voters and divide that by the total number of voters surveyed. This gives us or approximately 41% of the Tampa, Fl voters who identify as conservative.    For this question we find the apply for citizenship row, look across to find the total, and divide this by the total number of voters surveyed. We get or approximately 31% of these voters are in favor of the citizenship option.    For this question we are looking for the cell that is the intersection of those who identify as conservative and those who are in favor of the citizen option. This cell has 57 voters, so we divide that by the total number of voters. This gives us or or approximately 6.3% of these voters identify as conservatives and are in favor of the citizenship option.    The or in this question is inclusive, so we need to determine the number of voters who identify as liberal, who are in favor of the leaving the country option, or both.      Conservative  Moderate  Liberal  Total    (i) Apply for citizenship  57  120  101  278    (ii) Guest worker  121  113  28  262    (iii) Leave the country  179  126  45  350    (iv) Not sure  15  4  1  20    Total  372  363  175  910     In terms of the individual cells, the number of voters who have the specified characteristics is the sum , which we can divide by the total number of voters surveyed to get the percent. So, we have or approximately 53% of the voters identify as liberal or are in favor of the leave the country option.  Another way to calculate this is to add the total number who identify as liberal (175 voters) and the total number who are in favor of the leave the country option (350 voters), then subtract the double counted cell (45 voters) who are liberal and in favor of the leave the country option:     As we saw before, these are conditional statements. For the first part of this question, we want to focus just on those voters who identify as conservatives, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. We calculate that or approximately 15% of conservative voters are in favor of the citizenship option.  For the second part, we want to focus on just those voters who identify as moderate, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. Then we have or approximately 33% of moderate voters are in favor of the citizen option.  Finally, we want to focus on just those voters who identify as liberal, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. We calculate or approximately 58% of liberal voters are in favor of the citizenship option. Looking at these three percentages, it is clear that support of the citizenship option depends on political ideology. If support of the citizenship option were the same across political ideologies, then we would say that favoring the citizenship option and political ideology were independent of each other.         Empirical Probability  If our sample is representative of the population, then we can also interpret a percentage we calculate from a contingency table as a probability , or the likelihood that something will happen. Since a contingency table is constructed from data collected through sampling or an experiment, we call it an empirical or experimental probability. This is different from a theoretical probability which we will look at in the next section.    Finding Empirical Probabilities with a Contingency Table  Suppose that 60% of students in our class have a summer birthday (June, July, or August). Now suppose everyone's name and birth month are written on slips of paper and thrown into a bag. If we pull a slip of paper out of the bag at random, what is the probability that the selected student has a summer birthday? If you think there should be a 60% chance, you are right! The relative frequency of the characteristic of interest will be equal to its empirical probability. To write this as a probability statement, it would look like     Probability is a function named P , and the function is applied to what follows in the parentheses. Let's look at another example where we write probability statements and find empirical probabilities.    A survey of licensed drivers asked whether they had received a speeding ticket in the last year and whether their car is red. The results of the survey are shown in the contingency table to the right.      Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665     Find the probability that a randomly selected survey participant:   has a red car.    has had a speeding ticket in the last year.    has a red car and has not had a speeding ticket in the last year.    has a red car or has had a speeding ticket in the last year.    has had a speeding ticket in the last year given they have a red car.    who has received a speeding ticket in the last year also has a red car.    What do the answers to b and e suggest about the relationship between owning a red car and getting a speeding ticket?              Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665     To find , we divide the number of participants who own a red car by the total number of people surveyed: or 22.6%.        Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665      , we divide the number of participants who got a speeding ticket in the last year by the total number of people surveyed: or 9%.        Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665     To find , we find the intersection of the red car category and the no ticket category and divide by the total number of participants: or 20.3%        Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665     To find , we need to add those who drive a red car and did not have a speeding ticket (just red), those who had a speeding ticket and do not drive a red car (just ticket) and those who drive a red car and had a speeding ticket (both), and divide by the total number of participants:     Recall from our earlier discussion that we could also calculate the or probability as:     which gives us the same answer as counting the individual cells.        Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665     The probability is a conditional probability as we have seen before since it is conditional on the given characteristic occurring. In this problem, the given characteristic is owning a red car, so we isolate our attention to just the row of 150 red car owners and see how many have had a speeding ticket in the last year. Looking at the table, we see that there were 15 red car owners who had a speeding ticket in the last year, so we calculate:           Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665     This question is also asking for a conditional probability, , but it is phrased more like we would say it. In this case the given characteristic is that the person has received a speeding ticket, so we will isolate our attention to just the speeding ticket column. Among the 60 people who had a speeding ticket in the last year, we see that 15 also drove a red car. Now we can calculate the probability:     Notice that compared with part e, when we change the conditional characteristic, we change the denominator of the fraction.    In part b, we determined that there was a 9% chance of randomly selecting a participant who had received a speeding ticket in the last year. However, in part e we found that there was a 25% chance of receiving a ticket in the last year if the person had a red car. This seems to suggest that there is a higher likelihood of getting a speeding ticket if you own a red car. This means that getting a speeding ticket is dependent on whether the person drives a red car, since that increases the probability of getting a ticket. We cannot say, however, whether driving a red car makes you speed or whether people who tend to drive faster buy red cars.         Conditional Probabilities  We have mentioned conditional probabilities, which we find by isolating our attention to the given row or column. Here is another example of finding conditional probabilities.    A home pregnancy test was given to a sample of 93 cisgender women, and their pregnancy was then verified by a blood test. The contingency table below shows the home pregnancy test and whether or not they were actually pregnant as determined by the blood test. Find the probability that a randomly selected woman in the sample   was not pregnant given the home test was positive.    had a positive home pregnancy test given they were not pregnant.         Positive Test  Negative Test  Total    Pregnant  70  4  74    Not Pregnant  5  14  19    Total  75  18  93       Here are the solutions:   Since we are given the home test result was positive, we are limited to the 75 women in the positive test column, of which 5 were not pregnant. This gives:      Positive Test  Negative Test  Total    Pregnant  70  4  74    Not Pregnant  5  14  19    Total  75  18  93          Since we are given the woman is not pregnant, we are limited to the 19 women in the not pregnant row, of which 5 had a positive test. This gives:      Positive Test  Negative Test  Total    Pregnant  70  4  74    Not Pregnant  5  14  19    Total  75  18  93        This result is referred to as a false positive: A positive test result when the woman is not actually pregnant.       In this section we have learned about empirical probability. In the next section we will discuss another kind of probability that you may be familiar with – theoretical probability.

What is the probability that they earned an A given they were in the morning class?    What is the probability that they were in the morning class or they earned a B?                                     A professor surveyed students in her morning and afternoon Math 105 class, and asked what their class standing was.

What is the probability they had one credit card?    What is the probability they had no credit cards and is over 35?    What is the probability they are between the ages of 18 and 35, or have zero credit cards?    What is the probability they had no credit cards given that they are between the ages of 18 and 35?    What is the probability they have no credit cards given that they are over age 35?    Does it appear that having no credit cards depends on age? Or are they independent? Use probability to support your claim.                                       Yes, it appears that having no credit cards depends on age. The probability of having no credit cards for people over age 35 is significantly greater than the probability of having no credits for people between the ages of 18 and 35.       The following contingency table provides data from a sample of 6,224 individuals who were exposed to smallpox in Boston. Data taken from Mostly Harmless Probability & Statistics by Rachel Webb       Inoculated  Not Inoculated  Total    Lived  238  5136  5374    Died  6  844  850    Total  244  5980  6224        What is the probability that a person was inoculated?    What is the probability that a person lived?    What is the probability that a person died or was inoculated?    What is the probability that a person died given they were inoculated?    What is the probability that a person died given they were not inoculated?    Does it appear that survival depended on if a person were inoculated? Or are they independent? Use probability to support your claim.                                  Yes, it appears that survival was dependent if a person was inoculated. The percentage of deaths among the not inoculated group was nearly six times greater than the percentage of deaths among the inoculated group.       The contingency table below shows the survival data for the passengers of the Titanic.

What is the probability that a passenger was crew?    What is the probability that a passenger was first class and did not survive?    What is the probability that a passenger did not survive or was crew?    What is the probability that a passenger survived given they were first class?    What is the probability that a passenger survived given they were second class?    What is the probability that a passenger survived given they were third class?    Does it appear that survival depended on the passenger's class? Or are they independent? Use probability to support your claim.                                            Yes, it does appear that survival depended on the passenger's class. The probability of survival for first class passengers is significantly greater than the probability of survival for second class passengers and is more than double the probability of survival for third class passengers.

What is the probability that a shopper will purchase a game\/software given they have purchased a computer?    What is the probability that a shopper will purchase a game\/software given they did not purchase a computer?    Does it appear that purchasing a game\/software depends on whether the shopper purchased a computer? Or are they independent? Use probability to support your claim.

The probability of purchasing a game\/software for computer buyers was almost 50% greater than the probability of purchasing a game\/software among customers who did not purchase a computer.       A fitness center coach kept track over the last year of whether members stretched before they exercised, and whether or not they sustained an injury. Among the 400 members, 322 stretched before they exercised, 327 did not sustain an injury, and 270 both stretched and did not sustain an injury.     Create a contingency table for the information.      Injury  No Injury  Total    Stretched       Not Stretched       Total          What is the probability that a member sustained an injury?    What is the probability that a member sustained an injury and did not stretch?    What is the probability that a member stretched or did not sustain an injury?    What is the probability that a member sustained an injury given they stretched?    What is the probability that a member sustained an injury given they did not stretch?    Does it appear that sustaining an injury depends on whether the member stretches before exercising? Or are they independent? Use probability to support your claim.

  "body": "  910 randomly sampled registered voters from Tampa, FL were asked if they thought workers who have illegally entered the US should (i) be allowed to keep their jobs and apply for US citizenship, (ii) be allowed to keep their jobs as temporary guest workers but not be allowed to apply for US citizenship, or (iii) lose their jobs and have to leave the country. Not sure was also an option (iv). The results of the survey by political ideology are shown below SurveyUSA, News Poll #18927 , data collected Jan 27-29, 2012. Example adapted from Open Intro: Advanced High School Statistics , by Diez et al, used under CC-BY-SA 3.0 . . Use the contingency table to answer the questions.      Conservative  Moderate  Liberal  Total    (i) Apply for citizenship  57  120  101  278    (ii) Guest worker  121  113  28  262    (iii) Leave the country  179  126  45  350    (iv) Not sure  15  4  1  20    Total  372  363  175  910        What percent of the sampled Tampa, Fl voters identified themselves as conservatives?    What percent of the sampled voters are in favor of the citizenship option?    What percent of the sampled voters identify themselves as conservatives and are in favor of the citizenship option?    What percent of the sampled voters identify themselves as liberal or are in favor of the leaving the country option?    What percent of the sampled voters who identify as conservatives are also in favor of the citizenship option? What percent of moderate and liberal voters share this view?          To answer this question, we find the conservative column and look to the bottom cell for the total number of conservative voters and divide that by the total number of voters surveyed. This gives us or approximately 41% of the Tampa, Fl voters who identify as conservative.    For this question we find the apply for citizenship row, look across to find the total, and divide this by the total number of voters surveyed. We get or approximately 31% of these voters are in favor of the citizenship option.    For this question we are looking for the cell that is the intersection of those who identify as conservative and those who are in favor of the citizen option. This cell has 57 voters, so we divide that by the total number of voters. This gives us or or approximately 6.3% of these voters identify as conservatives and are in favor of the citizenship option.    The or in this question is inclusive, so we need to determine the number of voters who identify as liberal, who are in favor of the leaving the country option, or both.      Conservative  Moderate  Liberal  Total    (i) Apply for citizenship  57  120  101  278    (ii) Guest worker  121  113  28  262    (iii) Leave the country  179  126  45  350    (iv) Not sure  15  4  1  20    Total  372  363  175  910     In terms of the individual cells, the number of voters who have the specified characteristics is the sum , which we can divide by the total number of voters surveyed to get the percent. So, we have or approximately 53% of the voters identify as liberal or are in favor of the leave the country option.  Another way to calculate this is to add the total number who identify as liberal (175 voters) and the total number who are in favor of the leave the country option (350 voters), then subtract the double counted cell (45 voters) who are liberal and in favor of the leave the country option:     As we saw before, these are conditional statements. For the first part of this question, we want to focus just on those voters who identify as conservatives, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. We calculate that or approximately 15% of conservative voters are in favor of the citizenship option.  For the second part, we want to focus on just those voters who identify as moderate, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. Then we have or approximately 33% of moderate voters are in favor of the citizen option.  Finally, we want to focus on just those voters who identify as liberal, and from among that group determine the percent in favor of the citizenship option. We calculate or approximately 58% of liberal voters are in favor of the citizenship option. Looking at these three percentages, it is clear that support of the citizenship option depends on political ideology. If support of the citizenship option were the same across political ideologies, then we would say that favoring the citizenship option and political ideology were independent of each other.      "

  "body": "  A survey of licensed drivers asked whether they had received a speeding ticket in the last year and whether their car is red. The results of the survey are shown in the contingency table to the right.

Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665     The probability is a conditional probability as we have seen before since it is conditional on the given characteristic occurring. In this problem, the given characteristic is owning a red car, so we isolate our attention to just the row of 150 red car owners and see how many have had a speeding ticket in the last year. Looking at the table, we see that there were 15 red car owners who had a speeding ticket in the last year, so we calculate:           Speeding Ticket  No Speeding Ticket  Total    Red Car  15  135  150    Not Red Car  45  470  515    Total  60  605  665     This question is also asking for a conditional probability, , but it is phrased more like we would say it. In this case the given characteristic is that the person has received a speeding ticket, so we will isolate our attention to just the speeding ticket column. Among the 60 people who had a speeding ticket in the last year, we see that 15 also drove a red car. Now we can calculate the probability:     Notice that compared with part e, when we change the conditional characteristic, we change the denominator of the fraction.    In part b, we determined that there was a 9% chance of randomly selecting a participant who had received a speeding ticket in the last year. However, in part e we found that there was a 25% chance of receiving a ticket in the last year if the person had a red car. This seems to suggest that there is a higher likelihood of getting a speeding ticket if you own a red car. This means that getting a speeding ticket is dependent on whether the person drives a red car, since that increases the probability of getting a ticket. We cannot say, however, whether driving a red car makes you speed or whether people who tend to drive faster buy red cars.      "

In this section, we will focus on theoretical probability and compare the two types.   Alternative Video Lessons      Basic Probability Concepts  Let's begin with a brief introduction to some of the language and basic concepts of theoretical probability.    Experiment  If you roll a die, pick a card from a deck of playing cards, or randomly select a person and observe their hair color, you are conducting an experiment .    Events and Outcomes  The result of an experiment is an outcome , and a particular outcome, like rolling a five on a die, is called an event . An event can be a simple event or combination of outcomes, called a compound event .    Sample Space  The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes. For example, if we roll a six-sided die, the sample space S is the set .    If we roll an eight-sided die, describe the sample space and give at least two examples of simple events and compound events.    The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes, or equivalently, all simple events:   Examples of simple events are rolling a 1, rolling a 5, rolling a 6, and so on. Examples of compound events include rolling an even number, rolling a 5 or a 3, and rolling a number that is at least 4.      Equally Likely Outcomes  When the outcomes of an experiment are equally likely, we can calculate the probability of an event as the number of ways it can happen out of the total number of outcomes.   Theoretical Probability      We can write the result as a simplified fraction or as a decimal or percent.    Write the sample space for the sum of two fair six-sided dice and determine whether the outcomes are equally likely.    The sample space for the sum of two fair six-sided dice is . The different sums, however, are not equally likely. If we look at a table of the different possible outcomes when rolling two dice, we see that there are 36 possible combinations. We will summarize this in a table by listing each outcome in the sample space. Then we find the probabilities by counting the number of ways each sum can occur and dividing it by 36.      1  2  3  4  5  6    1          2          3          4          5          6               Sum  Probability    2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9     10     11     12      From the probability table we can see that rolling a sum of 7 has the highest probability and rolling a 2 or a 12 have the lowest probabilities.      Suppose we roll a fair six-sided die. Calculate the probability of:   rolling a 6.    rolling a number that is at least 4.    rolling an even number.    rolling a 5 or a 3.       Recall that the sample space is . Since each of the outcomes in the sample space is equally likely, we can find the probability of each event by counting the number of outcomes corresponding to the event and dividing by 6, the total number of equally likely outcomes.   There is only one way to roll a 6, so or approximately 16.7% There is a 16.7% chance of rolling a 6.    In probability we will often come across the phrases at least and at most.  At least means that value or greater. At most means that value or less. Since we are looking for the probability of rolling a number that is at least 4, we need the number of outcomes that are 4 or greater. There are 3 values that meet this condition: 4, 5, and 6. The probability is or 50%    Half of the numbers on a die are even, so we calculate: or 50%    There are two ways to roll a 5 or a 3, so or approxiamtely 33.3%. There is a 33.3% chance of rolling a 5 or a 3.         Suppose you have a bag containing 14 sweet cherries and 6 sour cherries. If you pick a cherry at random, what is the probability it will be sweet?    Each of the cherries are equally likely to be selected since our selection is random and we can assume there is no way to distinguish one cherry from another. This means that the probability of selecting a sweet cherry will be equal to the number of sweet cherries in the bag dived by the total number of cherries in the bag. Since there are 14 sweet cherries and a total of 20 cherries in the bag, we have:     There is a 70% chance of selecting a sweet cherry from the bag.      Certain and Impossible Events  A probability is always a value between 0 and 1, or from 0% to 100%. If the probability of an event is 0 there are no outcomes that correspond with that event and we say it is impossible . If the probability of an event is 1 then every outcome corresponds to that event and we say it is certain .       What is the probability of rolling an odd or even number on a six-sided die?    What is the probability of rolling an 8 on a six-sided die?          Since all the numbers are either even or odd, this event includes all of the outcomes in the sample space. This event is certain.     Since 8 is not one of the outcomes in the sample space, the event is impossible.          Complementary Events  Just as we saw in the logic chapter, the complement of an event A means A does not happen. We can refer to the complement as not A or . For example, consider the experiment of rolling a six-sided die and the simple event A = rolling a 6. The complement of event A is everything in the sample space that is not a 6: . Recall that we can illustrate the complement using a Venn diagram as shown below.    A Venn diagram with only one set A; The region outside the circle for A but inside the rectangle is shaded blue to represent the complement of the set or elements not in set A.    Notice that the outcomes from set A and the outcomes from set will together equal the universal set, which is the sample space in probability. The probabilities must add up to 1 or 100%. Therefore, we can use subtraction to find the probability of a complement.   Complement of an Event        If you roll an eight-sided die, what's the probability you don't get a 6?    Not rolling a 6 is the complement of rolling a 6, which is easier to calculate. Since there are 8 possible numbers to roll, we have:     There is an 87.5% chance of not rolling a 6.      Experimental vs. Theoretical Probability  Now that we have calculated experimental and theoretical probabilities, we can compare them. When we flip a fair coin, we say there is a 50% chance of getting heads. This is a theoretical probability because there are two equally likely outcomes – heads and tails – so we expect to get heads half of the time. But if you flip a coin, say 100 times, will you get heads exactly 50 times? Maybe, but you are more likely to get some number around 50 times. The number of heads you actually observe out of the total number of times you flip the coin is the experimental probability.    The table shows the numbers that came up after rolling a six-sided die 10 times. What is the experimental probability of rolling a 6? What is the theoretical probability of rolling a 6?     Roll  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10    Outcome  3  1  4  6  6  6  1  3  5  1       To find the experimental probability of rolling a 6, it would be helpful to change this into a frequency table. We list all the possible outcomes and count how many times each occurred.     Outcome  Frequency    1  3    2  0    3  2    4  1    5  1    6  3     According to our frequency table, we see that a 6 was rolled three times, so the experimental probability of rolling a 6 is or 30%.  Theoretically, however, we would expect the number 6 to come up 1 out of 6 times since there are 6 equally likely outcomes. Thus, the theoretical probability of rolling a 6 is or approximately 16.7%      The Law of Large Numbers  As we saw in the previous example, theoretical and experimental probabilities are not necessarily equal. However, experimental probability will eventually approach theoretical probability as we conduct more and more trials. This phenomenon is called the Law of Large Numbers . This means if you flip a fair coin a small number of times , the experimental probability is likely to be different each time and could be very different from the theoretical probability. But if you flip a coin a large number of times , the experimental probability becomes very close to the theoretical probability of 50%. The Law of Large Numbers is extremely powerful in that it allows us to approximate the theoretical probability of complex events – like changes in beliefs and opinions, likelihood of natural disasters, climate change effects – through repeated sampling and simulation.    Probability of Compound Events  Now that we have the basics in place, let's look at some compound probability problems that we will be studying in this course.    And Probabilities  As we saw with truth tables, the event A and B refers to an event where both A and B occur. These events may occur at the same time or they could happen in a sequence such as A and then B . How we calculate the theoretical probability of the event A and B (or A and then B ) depends on whether the two events are independent or dependent.    Independent and Dependent Events  Two events A and B are independent if the probability of B occurring is the same whether or not A occurs. If the probability of B is affected by the occurrence of A , then we say that the events are dependent .  Coin flips and die rolls are common examples of independent events – flipping heads does not change the probability of flipping heads the next time, nor does rolling a six change the probability that the next roll will be a six.  Another type of event is a selection event, such as randomly selecting or drawing items from a bag, etc. These are also independent if we draw with replacement . By replacing the item, we reset the probability back to what it was before we made the selection. Since the probability of each subsequent selection is the same as the first selection, the events are independent.  If we draw without replacement , however, like selecting multiple people for a committee, we change the total number of possible outcomes, thereby changing the probability of subsequent selections. Therefore, if we draw without replacement, the events will be dependent .    Determine whether the following events are independent or dependent.   Flipping a fair coin twice and getting heads both times.    Selecting a president and then a vice president at random from a pool of five equally qualified individuals.    The event that it will rain in Portland tomorrow and the event that it will rain in Beaverton tomorrow.    Wearing your lucky socks and getting an A on your exam.          The probability of getting heads on the first flip is 0.5 or 50%. After flipping heads, the probability of getting heads on the second flip is still 0.5 or 50%. Since the probability of flipping heads on the second flip did not change because we flipped heads on the first flip, the events are independent .    Since two different people will be put in the role of president and vice president, we are drawing without replacement and the events are therefore dependent .    If it is raining in Portland it is more likely that it will rain in Beaverton, so the events are dependent .    Although there may some sort of placebo effect at play in terms of confidence and persistence, the socks you wear do not have a direct effect on how well you do on your exam, so these events are independent .       To calculate and probabilities we multiply, but we need to determine whether the events are independent or dependent. If they are independent, then we can multiply the individual probability of each event because one does not affect the other. If the events are dependent, then we need to multiply by the conditional probability based on what has previously happened. Here is a summary of this.   And  Probabilities If events A and B are independent, then   If events A and B are dependent, then    The probability of B given A is called a conditional probability since it depends, or is conditional, on A occurring. We saw examples of conditional probability when we looked at contingency tables in the previous section.    Suppose you have a bag containing 6 red Legos, 4 green Legos, and 3 black Legos. We will make exactly two lego selections from the bag. What is the probability of selecting:   two red Legos in a row if we put the first red Lego back in the bag?    two red Legos in a row if we don't put the first Lego back in the bag?    a red Lego and then a green Lego if we do not put the red Lego back in the bag?          Since the outcomes are equally likely, the probability of selecting a red Lego is the number of red Legos divided by the total number of Legos, or .  If we replace the red Lego we selected (selections are independent), we go back to having 6 red Legos in the bag of 13 Legos total. Therefore,       If we do not replace the first red Lego (selections are dependent), then on our second draw there will only be 5 red Legos remaining, and 12 Legos in total. Therefore,       The probability of selecting a red Lego on the first draw is the same as in parts a and b. Since we are not putting the red Lego back into the bag, we will have only 12 Lego left in total, of which 4 are green. Therefore,          Let's look at an example where we repeat an event many times.    Suppose there is a 6% chance you will receive a citation if you ride the MAX train without a ticket. What is the probability that you get away without a single citation if you ride without purchasing a ticket for 20 days this month?    The first thing we want to recognize is that this question is essentially asking for the probability of no citation and no citation and no citation…. twenty times (one for each day you ride without buying a ticket). Since the outcomes are connected by an and , we know we will be multiplying the probabilities. In this case the the outcomes are independent (you are not more or less likely to get a citation if you already received a citation). Therefore,         Or Probabilities  The event A or B refers to an event that includes the outcomes of A or B or both . We have seen the inclusive or both in terms of sets and logic, and in terms of contingency tables. The way we calculate the probability of A or B depends on whether the events have characteristics that are overlapping or disjoint.    Overlapping or Disjoint Sets  Recall that disjoint means the same thing as not overlapping . Just like we saw in the logic and sets chapter, the set diagram on the left shows overlapping sets and the set diagram on the right shows disjoint sets.    Two set diagrams. The Venn diagram on the left shows two overlapping sets which have an intersecting area; The Venn diagram on the right shows two sets that are entirely separate, like cats and dogs.    To apply this to probability, we will look at an example of events that have overlapping characteristics, such as color and shape.    A prize machine is filled with 10 yellow erasers, 6 green erasers, 4 red pencil sharpeners, 8 yellow pencil sharpeners, and 5 red bouncy balls. Each prize is inside a plastic sphere, and the spheres are well mixed in the prize machine. Each game will get you just one prize. Determine the probability of   getting a yellow prize.    getting a red or yellow prize.    getting a prize that is yellow or an eraser.          Since yellow is a single event, we just need to know how many prizes there are in total, and how many of the prizes are yellow. The yellow prizes include the 10 yellow erasers and the 8 yellow pencil sharpeners.       For a red or yellow prize, the set of red and the set of yellow do not overlap. They are disjoint sets, so we will add the probability of getting a red prize to the probability of getting a yellow prize.       To find the probability of getting a prize that is yellow or an eraser, we need to be careful because these are overlapping sets. There are two ways to calculate this, and it is a lot like what we did with contingency tables. The first way is to add all the items separately, being careful not to double count.     The second way is to count the total of yellow items and the total of erasers, but the yellow erasers are in both sets, or the overlap. We would be counting them twice and so we subtract their joint probability.          Here is a summary of how we found the or probabilities.   Or Probabilities  If the sets are disjoint,   If the sets are overlapping,    We could also use the overlapping formula as a general formula, because in the case of disjoint sets, there is no intersection and . Here is another example with overlapping events.    What is the probability of rolling two fair dice and getting a pair or a sum of 6?    For complicated events it's a good idea to list all of the outcomes. Looking at the table of outcomes, we see that there are 6 outcomes that are pairs out of the 36 possible outcomes, and there are 5 outcomes that add to 6. We can also see that there is one outcome that is both a pair and a sum of 6, so the events are overlapping.      1  2  3  4  5  6    1          2          3          4          5          6           As in the last example, there are two ways to do this.  If we add all of the shaded squares without double counting, we get:     To use the subtraction method, we need to add the probability of rolling a pair to the probability of rolling a sum of 6 and subtract the overlap. Thus we have:     Now that we have looked at empirical and theoretical probability, we will be able to use them for something very important in the next section – expected value.      Exercises   A ball is drawn randomly from a jar containing 6 red marbles, 2 white marbles, and 5 yellow marbles. Find the probability of:     Drawing a white marble.    Drawing a red marble.

We can also see that there is one outcome that is both a pair and a sum of 6, so the events are overlapping.      1  2  3  4  5  6    1          2          3          4          5          6           As in the last example, there are two ways to do this.  If we add all of the shaded squares without double counting, we get:     To use the subtraction method, we need to add the probability of rolling a pair to the probability of rolling a sum of 6 and subtract the overlap. Thus we have:     Now that we have looked at empirical and theoretical probability, we will be able to use them for something very important in the next section – expected value.   "

  "title": "Expected Value",
  "body": " Expected Value   Expected Value   Students will be able to:     Make a probability model    Calculate the expected value for a probability model    Determine whether a game is fair      Expected value is one of the useful probability concept we will discuss. It has many applications, from insurance policies to making financial decisions, and it's one thing that the casinos and government agencies that run gambling operations and lotteries may hope most people never learn about.   Alternative Video Lesson      Expected Value  The expected value is the average gain or loss of an event if the procedure is repeated many times. To help get a better understanding of what expected value is and how it is used, consider the following scenario:  You are commissioned to design a game for a local carnival. Your proposed game will have players roll a six-sided die. If it comes up 6, they win $10. If not, they get to roll again. If they get a 6 on the second roll, then they win 3. If they do not get a 6 on the second roll, they lose. With the game design complete, you now need to decide how much the carnival game owner should charge players in order to make a profit over the long run.  To make a profit, the carnival needs to know how much they will pay in winnings, on average, over the long run and charge more than that. In other words, they must charge more than the expected value of the game.  One way to organize the outcomes and probabilities is with a probability model. A probability model or probability distribution is a table listing the possible outcomes and their corresponding probabilities. The outcomes will be the amounts a player can win, and we will calculate the probabilities using what we have learned about theoretical probability.  As we have seen with complements, probabilities in a probability distribution must add to 1, so that is important to check. Here is the probability model for the carnival game:     Outcome ($ won)  Rolling Event  Probability    $10  Roll a 6 on the first roll     $3  Roll not a 6 on the first roll and a 6 on the second roll     $0  Roll not a 6 on the first roll and not a 6 on the second roll      Think of the expected value as a weighted average. We could take the average of $10, $3, and $0, but they are not all equally likely. It is much more likely to win $0 than to win $10. So, to find the average, we multiply each outcome by the chance it will happen and add the products together.   Expected Value  Multiply each outcome by its probability and add up the products   In this case we have:     This tells us that over the long run, players can expect to win $2.08 per game. This also means that the carnival owner will be paying out an average of $2.08 per game! Since the carnival owner would rather not lose money by paying players over the long run we need to make sure to charge players enough to offset the average payout.  If the carnival owner charges exactly $2.08 to play, the game is considered a fair game since the expected winnings would be $0. In a fair game, the player isn't expected to win anything, nor is the owner expected to earn anything over the long run. However, if the carnival owner charges the player more than $2.08 to play, they will earn money over the long run.  Suppose you suggest charging $5 to play. We can determine the net winnings by subtracting the $5 the player has to pay from their expected winnings. This gives us:     This means that over the long run, players can expect to lose an average of $2.92 each game they play, and the carnival owner can expect to earn an average of $2.92 per game over the long run. Here's another example.    Pick4 is a game by the Oregon Lottery that costs $1 to play. In this game you pick 4 numbers in a specific pattern. If you get the exact sequence, you can in theory earn a lot of money. Suppose that the payouts are as follows. Determine the player's expected net winnings.     Prize ($)  Probability    $250     $500     $1000     $1500        This table is not quite a complete probability distribution since it is missing one important outcome: when the player loses. In that case the prize is $0. We need to add a line for this. The prize for this missing outcome is $0, and since losing is the complement to winning something , the probability will be:      Adding this information to the table gives a complete probability distribution. Now we can see that players are going to lose more than 99% of the time, so the expected value will be heavily weighted toward winning $0.     Prize ($)  Probability    $250     $500     $1000     $1500     $0  0.9961        Therefore, the player's expected winnings are $2.07, on average, over the long run. To find the expected net winnings, we subtract the cost to play. Since it costs $1 to play,     Assuming the given payouts are correct, this would be one game you would want to play for investment purposes since you can expect to earn $1.07 per game, on average, over the long run. Play a million times, and you just might become a millionaire!    In general, if the expected value of a game is negative, it is not a good idea to play, since in the long run you will lose money. It would be better to play a game with a positive expected value (good luck trying to find one!), although keep in mind that even if the average winnings are positive it could be the case that most people lose money and one very fortunate individual wins a great deal of money.  Not surprisingly, the expected value for casino games is always negative for the player, and therefore positive for the casino. It must be positive for the casino, or they would go out of business! Players just need to keep in mind that when they play a game repeatedly, they should expect to lose money. That is fine so long as you enjoy playing the game and think it is worth the cost, but it would be wrong to expect to come out ahead.  Expected value is not only used to determine the average amount won and lost at casinos and carnivals, it also has applications in business and insurance, just to name a few. Let's look at a couple of those applications.    For 3 months, a coffee shop tracked their morning sales of coffee, between 6am and 10am. The following results were recorded:     Number of cups sold  145  150  155  160  170    Probability  0.15  0.22  0.37  0.19  0.07     How many cups of coffee should they expect to sell each morning?    In this case the table tells us that 15% of the time they sell 145 cups of coffee between 6am and 10am, 22% of the time they sell 150 cups, 37% of the time they sell 155 cups, 19% of the time they sell 160 cups, and 7% of the time they sell 170 cups. Since the highest probability is associated with 155 cups, the expected value should lie somewhat close to this.  To find the expected number of coffees sold, we multiply each number of cups of coffee by its respective probability and then add the products.       This means that over the long run, the coffee shop can expect, on average, to sell around 154 cups of coffee each morning. This is an important tool for businesses since it helps inform them how much stock they should keep on hand.      On average, a 40-year-old man in the US has a 0.242% chance of dying in the next year According to the estimator at . An insurance company charges $275 annually for a life insurance policy that pays a $100,000 death benefit. What is the expected value for the insurance company on this policy?    The first thing we want to do is organize the probabilities and outcomes in a probability distribution table. There are two outcomes – either the policy holder dies, and the insurance company pays the benefit, or the policy holder does not die, and they do not pay anything.  The probability of paying the death benefit is equal to the chance of the person dying in the next year, and the probability of paying nothing is equal to the complement of the chance of dying in the next year.     Insurance payout  Probability    $100000  0.00242    $0  1-0.00242=0.99758     Then we can calculate:     So, the expected payout for the insurance company is $242, but they are charging $275 for the policy. Their net revenue would be     The insurance company is making, on average, $33 per policy per year. It shouldn't be too surprising because there are overhead costs and the insurance company can only afford to offer policies if they, on average, make money on them. But how much money should they make? As a consumer it is important to know about expected value.      Exercises   A bag contains 3 gold marbles, 6 silver marbles, and 28 black marbles. Someone offers to play this game: You randomly select on marble from the bag. If it is gold, you win $3. If it is silver, you win $2. If it is black, you lose $1.

That is, you would lose about $0.19 on average each time you pick a marble.       A bag contains 5 red marbles, 8 blue marbles, and 15 green marbles. Someone offers to play this game: You randomly select one marble from the bag. If it is blue, you win $3. If it is red, you win $2. If it is green, you lose $1.

A friend devises a game that is played by rolling a single six-sided fair (each side has equal probability of landing face up, once rolled) die once.

They estimate that 0.7% of their products will fail during that time, and it will cost them $350 to replace a failed product. If they charge $48 for the extended warranty, what is the company's expected profit or loss on each warranty sold?   The company's expected profit is $45.55 per warranty sold.    A company wants to offer a 3-year extended warranty in case their product fails after the original warranty period but within 3 years of the purchase. They estimate that 0.5% of their products will fail during that time, and it will cost them $400 to replace a failed product. If they charge $60 for the extended warranty, what is the company's expected profit or loss on each warranty sold?   The company's expected profit is $58 per warranty sold.    An insurance company estimates the probability of an earthquake in the next year to be 0.0013. The average damage done by an earthquake it estimates to be $60,000. If the company offers earthquake insurance for $100, what is their expected value of the policy?   The company's expected value on each policy is $22 which means they will make $22, on average, per policy sold.    An insurance company estimates the probability of a flood in the next year to be 0.0002. The average damage done by a flood is estimated to be $70,000. If the company offers flood insurance for $3000, what is their expected value of the policy?   The company's expected value on each policy is $2,986 which means they will make $2,986, on average, per policy sold.    You purchase a raffle ticket to help out a charity.

This is an important tool for businesses since it helps inform them how much stock they should keep on hand.   "

  "body": "  On average, a 40-year-old man in the US has a 0.242% chance of dying in the next year According to the estimator at . An insurance company charges $275 annually for a life insurance policy that pays a $100,000 death benefit. What is the expected value for the insurance company on this policy?    The first thing we want to do is organize the probabilities and outcomes in a probability distribution table. There are two outcomes – either the policy holder dies, and the insurance company pays the benefit, or the policy holder does not die, and they do not pay anything.  The probability of paying the death benefit is equal to the chance of the person dying in the next year, and the probability of paying nothing is equal to the complement of the chance of dying in the next year.     Insurance payout  Probability    $100000  0.00242    $0  1-0.00242=0.99758     Then we can calculate:     So, the expected payout for the insurance company is $242, but they are charging $275 for the policy. Their net revenue would be     The insurance company is making, on average, $33 per policy per year. It shouldn't be too surprising because there are overhead costs and the insurance company can only afford to offer policies if they, on average, make money on them. But how much money should they make? As a consumer it is important to know about expected value.   "

In doing this, it is very important to acknowledge the Native American genocide and race-based chattel slavery which are often left out of math textbooks.  We are including this history to show how racist policies, laws and practices like segregation, racial profiling, police brutality, mass incarceration, redlining and voter suppression continue to this day to limit the freedoms, rights and economic prospects of African Americans. With the COVID-19 pandemic and the death of George Floyd by a police officer, there is greater awareness of systemic racism than ever before.    Formation of the United States  Scholars estimate that people have lived in the Americas for over 20,000 years (Worrall, 2018). By the time Columbus arrived, more than 50 million people were living in the Americas and around 10 million Indegenous people were living in the area that would become the United States (History.com Editors, 2018).  The first colonists arrived in America in 1607 and African people who had been violently separated from their families and homeland were brought to Jamestown in 1619 as slaves. Slave labor was used on tobacco and cotton plantations, for domestic work and even as part of the labor for building the White House. The system of slavery was an integral part of the United States economic and political system (How Slavery Helped Build a World Economy, 2003).  At the same time, white settlements kept encroaching on the homeland of Native Americans. Many treaties were signed and then violated. For example, in 1785, the Treaty of Hopewell was signed with the Cherokees in Georgia, which set a boundary on white settlement, but there were already colonists past that border.  The U.S. government was officially formed in 1787. During the Constitutional Convention , the framers were tasked with making decisions on the three branches of government and how people (or those considered to be people) would be represented. At that time only white men with property were allowed to vote. Women were also considered to be property of their husband at the time.  In creating the Legislative Branch of government, it was decided that Congress would be made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Representation for the Senate would be equal with two senators per state. To account for the different sizes of the states, the representation in the House of Representatives would be proportional to the state's population, but there was a controversy over how to count the population.  During the Constitutional Convention, the northern and southern states were at odds on whom to count. The South wanted more representation in Congress which would also increase their power, so they argued to count slaves as part of their population. The southern states did not want to count slaves for taxation, however, because that would result in them paying more taxes.  Slaves were considered property, not humans, and they were not citizens. Therefore, they did not have the right to vote or participate in government. The anti-slavery North wanted to count only free people, which included free Blacks. This led to the Three-Fifths Compromise that determined three out of every five slaves would be counted toward a state's population and taxation (Clayton, 2015).  It is also important to note that there are about 4 million U.S. Citizens who live in the territories of Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico who do not have representatives or senators. They pay federal taxes like Social Security and Medicare but not Federal Income tax.    What is Apportionment?  The number of representatives each state gets is based on its population, so once the framers decided how to count the population, they had to figure out how to divide up the representatives. This math problem is called apportionment.   Apportionment is the problem of dividing up a fixed number of things among groups of different sizes. In the United States, there is a certain number of representatives as stated in the constitution, currently 435, and they need to be divided fairly among the 50 states. Since the states are different sizes, and we cannot use fractions of people, this is not an easy task. In addition, the population in each state may change over time. Every 10 years after the census is taken, the representatives are reapportioned.  The apportionment problem comes up in a variety of non-political areas too. Here are the rules for apportionment in general.   Apportionment rules     The things being divided up can exist only in whole numbers.    We must use all of the things being divided up, and we cannot use any more.    Each group must get at least one of the things being divided up.    The number of things assigned to each group should be at least approximately proportional to the population of the group. (Exact proportionality isn't possible because of the whole number requirement, but we should try to be close.)      In terms of the apportionment of the United States House of Representatives, these rules imply:   We can only have whole representatives (a state can't have 3.4 representatives).    We can only use the 435 representatives available.    Every state gets at least one representative.    The number of representatives each state gets should be approximately proportional to the state population. This way, the number of constituents each representative has should be approximately equal.     We will look at four ways of solving the apportionment problem, developed by different people: Hamilton, Jefferson, Webster, and the Huntington-Hill method that is used today. We will continue to look at U.S. history throughout this section including Hamilton, Jefferson and Webster's relationship to slavery.    Hamilton's Method  Alexander Hamilton (1755 - 1804) was raised in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands by a poor family. He was motivated by his low socioeconomic status to work himself into a higher social standing. He eventually came to the colonies and worked himself into circles of wealth and influence. While Hamilton wasn't pro-slavery and considered himself an abolitionist, when choosing between his societal status and moral obligation, he chose the former.  He wed Elizabeth Schuyler, who was from a prominent family who owned slaves. He was involved with the transactions of slaves for his in-laws which further muddled his anti-slavery stance. Furthermore, Hamilton also traded and sold slaves as part of his duties for the Continental Army.  Alexander Hamilton proposed the method that now bears his name. His method was approved by Congress in 1791 but was vetoed by President Washington. It was later adopted in 1852 and used through 1910. He begins by determining, to several decimal places, how many people each representative should represent (the divisor).   Hamilton's Method     Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the divisor .    Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the quota .   Since we can only allocate whole representatives, Hamilton resolved the whole number problem as follows:     Cut off all the decimal parts of all the quotas (but don't forget what the decimals were). This is the initial apportionment and will always be less than or equal to the total number of representatives. Add up the whole numbers.    If the total from Step 3 is less than the total number of representatives, assign the remaining representatives, one each, to the states whose decimal parts of the quota were largest, until the desired total is reached.  Make sure that each state ends up with at least one representative.      Let's see how this works in an example.    A new state is named after George Floyd, killed by the police in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2020. Floyd has three counties: King, Garner and Taylor. They are named after African Americans who were also victims of police brutality. Rodney King was brutally beaten by four white police officers and Eric Garner and Breonna Taylor were killed by the police. The Floyd State House of Representatives has 41 members. If the legislature wants to divide this representation along county lines (which is not required, but let's pretend they do), let's use Hamilton's method to apportion them. The populations of the counties are as follows:     County  Population    King  162,310    Garner  538,479    Taylor  197,145    Total  897,934     Step 1: First, we divide the total population by the number of representatives to find the divisor: .  Step 2: Now we determine each county's quota by dividing the county's population by the divisor: For example, for King, we take which equals 7.4111.     County  Population  Quota    King  162,310  7.4111    Garner  538,479  24.5872    Taylor  197,945  9.0017    Total  897,934      Step 3: Removing the decimal parts of the quotas gives our initial apportionment and we add those numbers up.     County  Population  Quota  Initial    King  162,310  7.4111  7    Garner  538,479  24.5872  24    Taylor  197,945  9.0017  9    Total  897,934   40     Step 4: We need 41 representatives, and right now we only have 40. The remaining one goes to the county with the largest decimal part, which is Garner:     County  Population  Quota  Initial  Final    King  162,310  7.4111  7  7    Garner  538,479  24. 5872  24 +1  25    Taylor  197,945  9.0017  9  9    Total  897,934   40  41     Our final apportionment is King: 7, Garner: 25, Taylor: 9, for a total of 41 representatives.      We will use Hamilton's method again, to apportion 75 seats for a new state of Lewis, which has five counties. Lewis and its counties are named for civil rights leaders John Lewis, Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Ella Baker, Daisy Bates and Roy Wilkins.    Step 1: The divisor is .  Step 2: Determine each county's quota by dividing its population by the divisor:     County  Population  Quota    Parks  49,875  3.5538    King  166,158  11.8395    Baker  82,888  5.9061    Bates  626,667  44.6528    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478    Total  1,052,567      Step 3: Remove the decimal part of each quota and add up the initial apportionment:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Parks  49,875  3.5538  3    King  166,158  11.8395  11    Baker  82,888  5.9061  5    Bates  626,667  44.6528  44    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478  9    Total  1,052,567   72     Step 4: We need 75 representatives and we only have 72, so we assign the remaining three, one each, to the three counties with the largest decimal parts, which are Baker, King, and Bates in that order:     County  Population  Quota  Initial  Final    Parks  49,875  3.5538  3  3    King  166,158  11. 8395  11 +1  12    Baker  82,888  5. 9061  5 +1  6    Bates  626,667  44. 6528  44 +1  45    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478  9  9    Total  1,052,567   72  75     Our final apportionment is Parks: 3, King: 12, Baker: 6, Bates: 45, and Wilkins: 9 for a total of 75 representatives.  Note that even though Parks County's decimal part is greater than .5, it isn't big enough to get an additional representative, because three other counties have greater decimal parts.    Hamilton's method obeys something called the Quota Rule. The Quota Rule isn't a law, but an idea that some people think is a good one.   Quota Rule  The Quota Rule says that the final number of representatives a state gets should be within one of that state's quota. Since we're dealing with whole numbers for our final answers, that means that each state should either go up to the next whole number above its quota, or down to the next whole number below its quota.     Problems with Hamilton's Method  After using Hamilton's method for many years, three paradoxes happened, on separate occasions, where unfair things happened in new apportionments. This led to other methods being needed.   The Alabama Paradox is named for an incident that happened during the apportionment that took place after the 1880 census. (A similar incident happened ten years earlier involving the state of Rhode Island, but the paradox is named after Alabama.) The post-1880 apportionment had been completed, using Hamilton's method and the new population numbers from the census. Then it was decided that because of the country's growing population, the House of Representatives should be made larger. That meant that the apportionment would need to be done again, still using Hamilton's method and the same 1880 census numbers, but with more representatives. The assumption was that some states would gain another representative and others would stay with the same number they already had (since there weren't enough new representatives being added to give one more to every state). The paradox is that Alabama ended up losing a representative in the process, even though no populations were changed, and the total number of representatives increased.   The New States Paradox happened when Oklahoma became a state in 1907. Oklahoma had enough population to qualify for five representatives in Congress. Those five representatives would need to come from somewhere, though, so five states, presumably, would lose one representative each. That happened, but another thing also happened: Maine gained a representative (from New York).   The Population Paradox happened between the apportionments after the census of 1900 and of 1910. In those ten years, Virginia's population grew at an average annual rate of 1.07%, while Maine's grew at an average annual rate of 0.67%. Virginia started with more people, grew at a faster rate, grew by more people, and ended up with more people than Maine. By itself, that doesn't mean that Virginia should gain representatives or Maine shouldn't, because there are lots of other states involved. But Virginia ended up losing a representative to Maine .    Jefferson's Method   All men are created equal, are words penned by our third president and Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson (1743 - 1826), in the preamble to the Constitution. However, over the course of his life, Jefferson owned around 600 slaves. Among these hundreds of slaves, Jefferson fathered at least six children with one of his slaves, Sally Hennings.  Over his lifetime and his writings, Jefferson wrestled with his conscience regarding slavery, which can be seen in documents such as drafts of the Constitution before its final version. In the end, his personal and monetary gain surpassed that of his concern for the enslaved.  Thomas Jefferson proposed a different method for apportionment. After Washington vetoed Hamilton's method, Jefferson's method was adopted, and used in Congress from 1791 through 1842. Jefferson, of course, had political reasons for wanting his method to be used rather than Hamilton's. Primarily, his method favors larger states, and his own home state of Virginia was the largest at the time. He would also argue that it's the ratio of people to representatives that is the critical thing, and apportionment methods should be based on that.  The first three steps of Jefferson's method are the same as Hamilton's. He found the same divisor and the same quota and cut off the decimal parts in the same way, giving the same initial apportionment that is less than the required total.  What changes is how Jefferson assigned the remaining representatives. He said that since we ended up with an answer that is too small, our divisor must have been too big. He changed the divisor by making it smaller and looked at the new total. He would raise or lower the divisor until he found one that produced the required total. This is a trial and error process that takes some patience.   Jefferson's Method  The first three steps are the same as Hamilton's    Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the divisor .    Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the quota .    Cut off all the decimal parts of all the quotas (but don't forget what the decimals were). This is the initial apportionment and will always be less than or equal to the total number of representatives. Add up the whole numbers.    If the total from Step 3 was less than the total number of representatives, reduce the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. If you lower it too far, increase it. Continue doing this until the total in Step 3 is equal to the total number of representatives. The divisor you end up using is called the modified divisor . This is a trial-and-error process.        We'll return to the state of Floyd and apply Jefferson's method. We begin, as we did with Hamilton's method, by finding the quotas with the original divisor, 21,900.82927.  Steps 1-3 are the same as Hamilton's Method. Since we will be using different divisors, we will write the divisor at the bottom of the population column to be clear what we are dividing each number in that column by. You can also write it above that column if you prefer.     County  Population  Quota  Initial    King  162,310  7.4111  7    Garner  538,479  24.5872  24    Taylor  197,145  9.0017  9    Total  897,934   40    Divisor  21,900.82927       We need 41 representatives, and this divisor gives only 40. We must reduce the divisor until we get 41 representatives. Let's try 21,500 as the divisor  Step 4:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    King  162,310  7.5493  7    Garner  538479  25.0455  25    Taylor  197,145  9.1695  9    Total  897,934   41    Divisor  21,500       That worked and our final apportionment is King: 7, Garner: 25, and Taylor: 9.  Notice that with the new, lower divisor, the quota for Garner County (the largest county in the state) increased by much more than those of King County or Taylor County.  In this example, we got lucky and found the modified divisor on the first try. If we still had 40, we would reduce the divisor more. If we had more than 41, we would need to raise it. We will show how to do the trial-and-error part in the next example.      We'll apply Jefferson's method for Lewis. The original divisor of 14,034.22667 gave these results:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Parks  49,875  3.5538  3    King  166,158  11.8395  11    Baker  82,888  5.9061  5    Bates  626,667  44.6528  44    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478  9    Total  1,052,567   72    Divisor  14,034.22667       We need 75 representatives and we only have 72, so we need to use a smaller divisor. Let's try lowering it to 13,500:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Parks  49,875  3.6944  3    King  166,158  12.3080  12    Baker  82,888  6.1399  6    Bates  626,667  46.4198  46    Wilkins  126,979  9.4059  9    Total  1,052,567   76    Divisor  13,500       We got a total of 76 representatives which is too many, so we lowered it too far. We need a divisor that's greater than 13,500 but less than 14,034.22667. Let's try 13,700:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Parks  49,875  3.6405  3    King  166,158  12.1283  12    Baker  82,888  6.0502  6    Bates  626,667  45.7421  45    Wilkins  126,979  9.2685  9    Total  1,052,567   75    Divisor  13,700       Using a modified divisor of 13,700 gives us exactly 75 representatives. Note there is usually more than one modified divisor that will work.  This can take a lot of writing, so in practice, we can write this all out in one table. With each try we are dividing the population by the new divisor to get the new quotas.     County  Population  Quota  Initial  2nd Quota  2nd Try  3rd Quota  Final    Parks  49,875  3.5538  3  3.6944  3  3.6405  3    King  166,158  11.8395  11  12.3080  12  12.1283  12    Baker  82,888  5.9061  5  6.1399  6  6.0502  6    Bates  626,667  44.6528  44  46.4198  46  45.7421  45    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478  9  9.4059  9  9.2685  9    Total  1,052,567   72   76   75    Divisor  14,034.22667    13,500   13,700      Notice, in comparison to Hamilton's method, that although the results were the same, they came about in a different way, and the outcome was almost different. Bates County (the largest) almost went up to 46 representatives before King (which is much smaller) got to 12. Although that didn't happen here, it can. Divisor-adjusting methods like Jefferson's are not guaranteed to follow the quota rule.      Webster's Method  Daniel Webster (1782-1852) was a lawyer, congressman, Senator of Massachusetts and also served as the U.S. Secretary of State. He was from the North and did not own slaves. He was an opponent of slavery extension and he spoke against annexing Texas and against going to war with Mexico. He argued, however, that no law was needed to prevent the further extension of slavery in new states and he supported the Compromise of 1850, which disappointed his abolitionist supporters (History.com Editors, 2018b).  Webster proposed a method similar to Jefferson's in 1832. It was adopted by Congress in 1842 but replaced by Hamilton's method in 1852. It was then adopted again in 1911. The difference is that Webster rounded the quotas to the nearest whole number rather than dropping the decimal parts. If that didn't produce the exact number of representatives, he adjusted the divisor like in Jefferson's method. (In Jefferson's case, the first adjustment will always be to make the divisor smaller. That is not always the case with Webster's method because some numbers may be rounded up.)   Webster's Method  Steps 1-2 are the same as Hamilton and Jefferson    Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the divisor .    Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the quota .    Round all the quotas to the nearest whole number (but don't forget what the decimals were). This is the initial apportionment. Add up the whole numbers.    If the total from Step 3 is less than the total number of representatives, reduce the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. If the total from step 3 is larger than the total number of representatives, increase the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. Continue doing this until the total in Step 3 is equal to the total number of representatives. The divisor we end up using is called the modified divisor . This is a trial-and-error process.      Let's see how Webster's method works in this example:    We will look at Floyd again, with an initial divisor of 21,900.82927 and 41 representatives:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    King  162,310  7.4111  7    Garner  538,479  24.5872  25    Taylor  197,145  9.0017  9    Total  897,934   41    Divisor  21,900.82927       This time Garner is the only county with a decimal of 0.5 or higher, so it gets rounded up. This gives the required total, so we're done.      Let's look at Lewis again, with an initial divisor of 14,034.22667 and 75 representatives:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Parks  49,875  3.5538  4    King  166,158  11.8395  12    Baker  82,888  5.9061  6    Bates  626,667  44.6528  45    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478  9    Total  1,052,567   76    Divisor  14,034.22667       This is one too many, so we need to increase the divisor. Let's try 14,100:     County  Population  Quota  Initial    Parks  49,875  3.5372  4    King  166,158  11.7843  12    Baker  82,888  5.8786  6    Bates  626,667  44.4445  44    Wilkins  126,979  9.0056  9    Total  1,052,567   75    Divisor  14,100       This gives us exactly 75, so we're done. This is how it would look all in one table:     County  Population  Quota  Initial  2nd Quota  2nd Try    Parks  49,875  3.5538  4  3.5371  4    King  166,158  11.8395  12  11.7843  12    Baker  82,888  5.9061  6  5.8786  6    Bates  626,667  44.6528  45  44.4445  44    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478  9  9.0056  9    Total  1,052,567   76   75    Divisor  14,034.22667    14,100        Like Jefferson's method, Webster's method carries a bias in favor of larger states but rounding the quotas to the nearest whole number greatly reduces this bias. Notice that Bates County, the largest, is the one that gets a representative trimmed because of the increased quota.  Also, like Jefferson's method, Webster's method does not always follow the quota rule, but it follows the quota rule much more often than Jefferson's method does. In fact, if Webster's method had been applied to every apportionment of Congress in all of U.S. history, it would have followed the quota rule every single time.    Land Rights, Citizenship and Voting Rights  In 1830 the Indian Removal Act was signed by President Jackson. The Act relocated Native Americans to land west of the Mississippi and the forced journey is known as the Trail of Tears . To learn more, here is a link to an online museum exhibit with a timeline of Native American history and artifacts .  Toward the end of the Civil War, slaves were freed by Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation on January 1st, 1863, but it was not until June 19th, 1865 that the last group of slaves in Texas learned they had been freed. This is now celebrated as Juneteenth . You can read more about the timeline of slavery in this Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia .  Although they were technically free, Black people still faced unequal and unjust treatment. After Black men were granted the right to vote in 1869, voter suppression laws like poll taxes and literacy tests were implemented barriers to voting (American Civil Liberties Union, 2020).  In 1887, the Dawes Act was passed, which allotted Native American land to individuals and 60 million acres were taken by the government or non-Indian homesteaders (Indian Land Trust Tenure Foundation, 2020). This act also provided citizenship under certain restrictions which theoretically allowed native men to vote. All women were granted the right to vote in 1920, but the barriers enacted for men of color applied to women of color as well. You can read more about voting rights and suppression in this online timeline .    Huntington-Hill Method  In 1920, no new apportionment was done, because Congress couldn't agree on the method to be used. They appointed a committee of mathematicians to investigate, and they recommended the Huntington-Hill Method. They continued to use Webster's method in 1931, but after a second report recommending Huntington-Hill, it was adopted in 1941 and is the method of apportionment still used today.  The Huntington-Hill Method is similar to Webster's method, but attempts to minimize the difference in the percentage of how many people each representative will represent.   Huntington-Hill Method  The first two steps are the same as the previous methods    Determine how many people each representative should represent. Do this by dividing the total population of all the states by the total number of representatives. This answer is called the divisor .    Divide each state's population by the divisor to determine how many representatives it should have. Record this answer to several decimal places. This answer is called the quota .    Cut off the decimal part of the quota to obtain the lower quota , which we'll call . Compute , which is the geometric mean of the lower quota and one value higher.    Instead of using 0.5 to round like we are used to, we use the geometric mean. If the quota is as large or larger than the geometric mean, round up; if the quota is smaller than the geometric mean, round down. This is the initial allocation. Add up the resulting whole numbers.    If the total from Step 4 is less than the total number of representatives, reduce the divisor and recalculate the quota and allocation. If the total from step 4 is larger than the total number of representatives, increase the divisor and recalculate. Continue doing this until the total is equal to the exact number of representatives. The divisor we end up using is called the modified divisor . This is a trial-and-error process.        What is the Geometric Mean?  Let's look at why Hill and Huntington decided to use the geometric mean for rounding instead of the arithmetic mean of 0.5, which is halfway between two numbers. By calculating some geometric means and looking at them in a table we can see a pattern:    Geometric Mean Pattern        1     2     3     4         10         100       Notice that each geometric mean is between and . For smaller numbers, the decimal part is less than 0.5 and as n gets larger, the decimal part gets closer and closer to 0.5. This gives smaller states a chance to round up before larger states. That's how the Hill-Huntington method reduces the bias in favor of larger states.  Now let's see how to use the geometric mean in an example.    Again, we will practice with Floyd, with an initial divisor of 21,900.82927 and 41 representatives:     County  Population  Quota  Lower Quota  Geometric Mean  Initial    King  162,310  7.4111  7   7    Garner  538,479  24.5872  24   25    Taylor  197,945  9.0017  9   9    Total  897,934     41    Divisor  21,900.82927         Notice that for Garner, the quota of 24.5872 is above the geometric mean of 24.49, so we round up to 25. This gives the required total, so we're done.      Again, here is Lewis, with an initial divisor of 14,034.22667:     County  Population  Quota  Lower Quota  Geometric Mean  Initial    Parks  49,875  3.5538  3   4    King  166,158  11.8395  11   12    Baker  82,888  5.9061  5   6    Bates  626,667  44.6528  44   45    Wilkins  126,979  9.0478  9   9    Total  1,052,567     76    Divisor  14,034.22667         We end up with 76 which is too many, so we need to increase the divisor. Let's try 14,100:     County  Population  Quota  Lower Quota  Geometric Mean  2nd Try    Parks  49,875  3.5372  3   4    King  166,158  11.7843  11   12    Baker  82,888  5.8786  5   6    Bates  626,667  44.4445  44   44    Wilkins  126,979  9.0056  9   9    Total  1,052,567     75    Divisor  14,100         This time Bates had a quota less than its geometric mean, so it did not get rounded up and we have exactly 75 representatives.  In both these cases, the apportionment produced by the Huntington-Hill method was the same as those from Webster's method, but that will not always be the case.    In 1980, two mathematicians, Peyton Young and Mike Balinski, proved what we now call the Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem.   Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem  The Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem shows that any apportionment method which always follows the quota rule will be subject to the possibility of paradoxes like the Alabama, New States, or Population paradoxes. In other words, we can choose a method that avoids those paradoxes, but only if we are willing to give up the guarantee of following the quota rule.     Consider a small country with 5 states, two of which are much larger than the others. We need to apportion 70 representatives. Apportion the representatives using both Webster's method and the Huntington-Hill method.     State  Population    A  300,500    B  200,000    C  50,000    D  38,000    E  21,500       Step 1: The total population is 610,000. Dividing this by the 70 representatives gives the divisor: 8714.286.  Step 2: Dividing each state's population by the divisor gives the quotas.     State  Population  Quota    A  300,500  34.48361    B  200,000  22.95082    C  50,000  5.737705    D  38,000  4.360656    E  21,500  2.467213    Total  610,000     Divisor  8714.286       Webster's Method   Step 3: Using Webster's method, we round each quota to the nearest whole number using the rounding rule of 0.5 or higher to round up.     State  Population  Quota  Initial    A  300,500  34.48361  34    B  200,000  22.95082  23    C  50,000  5.737705  6    D  38,000  4.360656  4    E  21,500  2.467213  2    Total  610,000   69    Divisor  8714.286       Step 4: Adding these up only gives us 69 representatives, so we adjust the divisor down. We try 8,700, which gives us 70 representatives. Notice that State A, the largest state, is the one that got rounded up the second time.     State  Population  Quota  Initial    A  300,500  34.54023  35    B  200,000  22.98851  23    C  50,000  5.747126  6    D  38,000  4.367816  4    E  21,500  2.471264  2    Total  610,000   70    Divisor  8,700        Huntington-Hill Method   Step 3: Using the Huntington-Hill method, we cut off the decimal to find the lower quota, then calculate the geometric mean based on each lower quota. If the quota is less than the geometric mean, we round down; if the quota is more than the geometric mean, we round up.     State  Population  Quota  Lower Quota  Geometric Mean  Initial    A  300,500  34.48361  34  34.49638  34    B  200,000  22.95082  23  22.49444  23    C  50,000  5.737705  6  5.477226  6    D  38,000  4.360656  4  4.472136  4    E  21,500  2.467213  2  2.44949  3    Total  610,000     70    Divisor  8714.286         These allocations add up to 70. Notice that this allocation is different than that produced by Webster's method. In this case, state E, which is smaller, got one more seat and state A got one less.    In this section we have learned four different methods of apportionment used in U.S. history, intertwined with the U.S. treatment of women, Native Americans and Black people. In the next section we will continue with our brief history of voting rights and look at different methods used for voting.

Try Jefferson's method for 11 seats. Does that solve the problem?         A: 4 seats, B: 4 seats, C: 2 seats    It is not possible to assign 11 seats with Hamilton's method in this case.    States A and C are the same size, so they have the same decimal value. They would both get an additional seat at the same time but there is only one seat to give. Answers will vary on fair solutions.    Yes, with a modified divisor of 1200 we get A: 5 seats, B: 5 seats and C: 1 seat.

If the legislature grows to 11 seats, use Hamilton's method to apportion the seats.    If there could only be 10 seats, what do you think would be a fair solution?         A: 5 seats, B: 5 seats, C: 0 seats. Each state must have at least one seat so that rule is not met.    With 11 seats we have 5 seats, B: 5 seats, C: 1 seat, so it works in this case.    Answers will vary on fair solutions.       A state with five counties has 50 seats in their legislature. Using Hamilton's method, apportion the seats based on the 2010 census, then again using the 2020 census. Explain what happened in 2020 apportionment. Do you think it is fair?     County  2000 Population  2010 Population    Douglass  60,000  60,000    Parks  31,200  31,200    King  69,200  72,400    Du Bois  81,600  81,600    Lewis  118,000  118,400      2010: Douglass: 8, Parks: 4, King: 10, Du Bois: 11, Lewis: 17  2020: Douglass: 8, Parks: 5, King: 10, Du Bois: 11, Lewis: 16  The populations in King and Lewis counties grew, but Parks got an extra seat from Lewis. This doesn't seem fair.    A state with five counties has 62 seats in their legislature. Using Hamilton's method, apportion the seats based on the 2010 census, then again using the 2010 census. Explain what happened in 2020 apportionment. Do you think it is fair?

This seems reasonable because Gray grew more than Floyd did.    A school district has two high schools: Clatsop, serving 1715 students, and Siletz, serving 7364. The district could only afford to hire 13 guidance counselors.   Determine how many counselors should be assigned to each school using Hamilton's method.    The following year, the district expands to include a third school, Cayuse, serving an additional 2989 students. Based on the divisor from above, how many additional counselors should be hired for Cayuse?    After hiring that many new counselors, the district recalculates the reapportion using Hamilton's method. Determine the outcome.    Explain what happened in the new apportionment. Do you think the outcome from part c is fair? Why or why not.         Clatsop: 2 counselors, Siletz: 11 counselors    The divisor was 698.38, so 4 new guidance counselors should be hired for Cayuse.    Clatsop: 3 counselors, Siletz: 10 counselors, Cayuse: 4 counselors    Cayuse did get 4 counselors, but one of the counselors from Siletz went to Clatsop. That doesn't seem fair because their populations didn't change.       A school district has two middle schools: Tubman, serving 451 students, and Blackshear, serving 176. The district could afford to hire 8 art teachers.   Determine how many art teachers should be assigned to each school using Hamilton's method.    The following year, the district expands to include a third school, Banneker, serving 231 additional students. Based on the divisor from above, how many additional art teachers should be hired for the new school?    After hiring that many new art teachers, the district recalculates the reapportion using Hamilton's method. Determine the outcome.    Explain what happened in the new apportionment. Do you think the outcome from part c is fair? Why or why not.         Tubman: 6 art teachers, Blackshear: 2 art teachers    The divisor was 78.375 so 2 new art teachers should be hired for Banneker.    Tubman: 5 art teachers, Blackshear: 2 art teachers, Banneker: 3 art teachers    In the new apportionment, Banneker got 3 art teachers, taking one from Tubman school. The quota for Banneker was 2.947, so it seems reasonable that Banneker would get 3 art teachers.       "

  "body": "  A new state is named after George Floyd, killed by the police in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2020. Floyd has three counties: King, Garner and Taylor. They are named after African Americans who were also victims of police brutality. Rodney King was brutally beaten by four white police officers and Eric Garner and Breonna Taylor were killed by the police. The Floyd State House of Representatives has 41 members. If the legislature wants to divide this representation along county lines (which is not required, but let's pretend they do), let's use Hamilton's method to apportion them. The populations of the counties are as follows:     County  Population    King  162,310    Garner  538,479    Taylor  197,145    Total  897,934     Step 1: First, we divide the total population by the number of representatives to find the divisor: .  Step 2: Now we determine each county's quota by dividing the county's population by the divisor: For example, for King, we take which equals 7.4111.     County  Population  Quota    King  162,310  7.4111    Garner  538,479  24.5872    Taylor  197,945  9.0017    Total  897,934      Step 3: Removing the decimal parts of the quotas gives our initial apportionment and we add those numbers up.     County  Population  Quota  Initial    King  162,310  7.4111  7    Garner  538,479  24.5872  24    Taylor  197,945  9.0017  9    Total  897,934   40     Step 4: We need 41 representatives, and right now we only have 40. The remaining one goes to the county with the largest decimal part, which is Garner:     County  Population  Quota  Initial  Final    King  162,310  7.4111  7  7    Garner  538,479  24. 5872  24 +1  25    Taylor  197,945  9.0017  9  9    Total  897,934   40  41     Our final apportionment is King: 7, Garner: 25, Taylor: 9, for a total of 41 representatives.

  "body": "  We'll return to the state of Floyd and apply Jefferson's method. We begin, as we did with Hamilton's method, by finding the quotas with the original divisor, 21,900.82927.  Steps 1-3 are the same as Hamilton's Method. Since we will be using different divisors, we will write the divisor at the bottom of the population column to be clear what we are dividing each number in that column by. You can also write it above that column if you prefer.     County  Population  Quota  Initial    King  162,310  7.4111  7    Garner  538,479  24.5872  24    Taylor  197,145  9.0017  9    Total  897,934   40    Divisor  21,900.82927       We need 41 representatives, and this divisor gives only 40.

Notice that with the new, lower divisor, the quota for Garner County (the largest county in the state) increased by much more than those of King County or Taylor County.  In this example, we got lucky and found the modified divisor on the first try. If we still had 40, we would reduce the divisor more. If we had more than 41, we would need to raise it. We will show how to do the trial-and-error part in the next example.   "

Bates County (the largest) almost went up to 46 representatives before King (which is much smaller) got to 12. Although that didn't happen here, it can. Divisor-adjusting methods like Jefferson's are not guaranteed to follow the quota rule.   "

Dividing this by the 70 representatives gives the divisor: 8714.286.  Step 2: Dividing each state's population by the divisor gives the quotas.

  "body": " Voting Methods     Students will be able to:     Read a voter preference schedule for ranked choice voting    Calculate the minimum number of votes to win a majority    Find the winner of an election using the plurality method    Find the winner of an election using the instant runoff method    Find the winner of an election using the Borda count method    Find the winner of an election using the pairwise (Condorcet) method       Alternative Video Lessons      Voting Rights  Now that we have studied how to apportion the number of representatives for each state, along with a brief history of the U.S. government, we want to look at how representatives and other public officials are elected. There are also many other situations where a group consensus is needed, and some type of voting occurs. You may be most familiar with systems where you get one vote and the candidate with the most votes wins. However, there are many other ways of determining a winner. We will look at several voting methods in this section.  For an election using any of these methods to be fair, each person must have an equal right to vote and an equal ability to exercise that right. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibited any election practice that denies the right to vote based on race, but key portions of the law have been invalidated since then. Voter suppression continues today in different forms such as purging voter rolls, eliminating polling places and voter identification laws, which can also affect transgender people.   The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act was passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2019 to restore elements of the Voting Rights Act and make it possible to enforce the law. It has not been taken up in the Senate, though. Follow this link if you would like to read a more detailed timeline of voting rights .    Ranked Choice Ballots  To use some of the methods we are going to study, we need to know more than just each person's first choice. We also need to know their 2nd and 3rd choices, and so on. A ballot where each person ranks all of the choices in order of their preference is called a ranked choice ballot .   The image to the right shows an example of a ranked choice ballot Ranked Choice Ballot , Copyright 2020 Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 . Ranked choice ballots can be used in elections by mail or in person at polling places. Let's see how to tally the results from a ranked choice election.   A ranked choice ballot with three candidates for favorite flavor of ice cream: strawberry, chocolate and vanilla. There is a grid for voters to select their first, second and third choice.      Students are voting for their class president and the candidates are Omar (O), Ana (A), and Helena (H). They have ranked the candidates according to their preference.      Vien  Ana  Marv  Tasha  Eve  Omar  Lupe  Dave  Helena  Jimmy    1st choice  A  A  O  H  A  O  H  O  H  A    2nd choice  O  H  H  A  H  H  A  H  A  H    3rd choice  H  O  A  O  O  A  O  A  O  O         Preference Schedule  To simplify this data, we create a preference schedule which combines all the people who voted with the exact same ranking. For example, Tasha, Lupe, and Helena, all voted in the same way, HAO. So, we will list that combination once, with the number 3 at the top of that column. Three students also voted for AHO, and OHA. One student voted for the ranking AOH. Below is the preference schedule.     Number of voters  1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O    Notice that by totaling the vote counts across the top of the preference schedule we can see the total number of votes cast: total votes.     Plurality Method  The voting method you may be most familiar with in the United States is the plurality method . In the plurality method, the candidate with the most first-choice votes is declared the winner.  There is a difference between a majority and a plurality. For a majority, a candidate must have over 50% of the votes. There are some states that require a majority in order to win an election. In more cases, though, only a plurality is required, which means having more votes than any other candidate. If a tie occurs without using ranked choice voting, then a new run-off election would be required.    In our election from above, we had this preference table:     Number of voters  1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O     For the plurality method, we only look at the 1st choice row. Totaling them up:   Ana: votes    Omar: votes    Helena: votes     Ana is the winner using the plurality voting method.  Notice that Ana won with 4 out of 10 votes, or 40% of the votes, which is a plurality of the votes, but not a majority.      How Many Votes are Needed to Win?  If we know how many voters there are, we can calculate the minimum number of votes needed for a majority win.  Continuing from above, there are 10 voters, so we divide that by 2 or multiply by 0.5 to find 50%. Then we round up to the next whole number to get just over 50%.   . Then we round up to 6 votes.  Exactly half of the votes would be a tie, so we round up to the next whole number. A candidate would need 6 out of 10 votes to win a majority. If there was an odd number of voters we would divide by 2 and get a decimal. Let's say there were 13 voters:   . Then we round up to 7 votes.  Then we round up to the next whole number, which is 7 votes. A candidate can win a plurality with fewer votes than the majority, as long as they have more than any other candidate.    Insincere Voting  In a system with only two major political parties like the United States, it can be nearly impossible for third-party candidates to break through. You may feel like you would be wasting your vote if you voted for a third-party candidate. Consider this example.    Here is a two-party election with preferences shown below. It is a close race, but candidate B would win.     Number of voters  96  100    1st choice  A  B    2nd choice  B  A     Suppose a third candidate, C, entered the race, and a segment of voters sincerely want to vote for that third candidate. Here is the new preference schedule.     Number of voters  96  90  10    1st choice  A  B  C    2nd choice  B  A  B    3rd choice  C  C  A     The ten people who prefer candidate C are in a bind because if they vote for C, then A will win, but they prefer B over A. It is likely that they will vote for B, their second choice, to keep A from winning.    Situations like this can lead to insincere voting. Insincere voting is when a person doesn't vote according to their actual preference for strategic purposes. In the case above, a person who wants to vote for a third-party candidate realizes it would take a vote away from their major party candidate. Not wanting to see their party lose the election, they vote for the major party candidate.    Instant Runoff Method  The Instant Runoff Method is a modification of the plurality method that attempts to address the issue of insincere voting.  The voting is done with ranked choice ballots and a preference schedule is generated. Then we tally all the first-choice votes. The candidate with the least first-place votes is eliminated, but any votes for that candidate are transferred to the voters' next choice. The process continues until one candidate has a majority. We will show you how it works with an example.    Consider the preference schedule below, in which a committee is choosing a chairperson. The candidates are labeled A, B, C, D, and E for simplicity. Here is the preference schedule:     Number of voters  3  5  1  5  7  2  1    1st choice  B  C  C  B  D  A  E    2nd choice  C  A  B  D  C  E  D    3rd choice  A  E  B  C  A  B  B    4th choice  D  D  E  A  E  C  A    5th choice  E  B  A  E  B  D  C     Let's start by tallying the first-choices.     A:  B:  C:  D:  E:   If this was a plurality election, B would be the winner with 8 first-choice votes.     Round 1  We make our first elimination. Choice E has the fewest first-place votes, so we eliminate E from the election. To transfer the 1 vote, we look at the person who voted for E in the last column. Their second choice was D, so we transfer that one vote to D, who will now have 8 votes:    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:     Round 2  There are 24 votes in total, so a majority would be 13 votes. Since no candidate has the majority, we eliminate the next candidate with the fewest votes, which is A. We look at the column for the two people who chose A. Their second choice was E, who is already eliminated. Their third choice is B, so their 2 votes are transferred to B, for a total of 10:    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:     Round 3  Now C has the fewest votes, and there are two columns for C in the preference schedule. Five people who voted for C chose A second, then E (who have already been eliminated), then D. So, we transfer their 5 votes to D. One person who voted for C selected B as their second choice, so their one vote goes to B. Then we tally the votes for each remaining candidate.    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:   Now we can see that D is the winner of the instant runoff method with 13 votes. We can stop this method earlier if a candidate reaches a majority.       The Instant Runoff Method is similar to the idea of holding runoff elections, but since every voter's order of preference is recorded on the ballot, the runoff can be computed quickly without requiring a second costly election. It also makes it safe to vote for a third-party candidate knowing that your vote will go to your second choice if your first choice can't win.  This voting method is used in several places around the world, including the election of members of the Australian House of Representatives, statewide elections in Maine, and local elections in Benton County, Oregon (Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center, 2020).    Borda Count (Point System)  Borda Count is another voting method, named for Jean-Charles de Borda, who developed the system in 1770. In this method, points are assigned to each candidate based on their ranking; 1 point for last choice, 2 points for second-to-last choice, and so on. The point values are totaled, and the candidate with the largest point total is the winner. We'll show you how to do it in the next example.    A group of PCC students are getting together for a student leadership conference and they need to decide where to meet. Their members are from four campuses: Sylvania, Rock Creek, Cascade and Southeast. The votes for where to hold the conference were:     Number of voters  31  25  10  14    1st choice  Sylvania  Rock Creek  Southeast  Cascade    2nd choice  Southeast  Cascade  Cascade  Rock Creek    3rd choice  Rock Creek  Sylvania  Sylvania  Southeast    4th choice  Cascade  Southeast  Rock Creek  Sylvania     Now we will add a column on the left side of the table for the points. Then we multiply the points by the number of voters who put each candidate in that rank,     Points  Number of voters  31  25  10  14    4  1st choice  Sylvania  Rock Creek  Southeast  Cascade    3  2nd choice  Southeast  Cascade  Cascade  Rock Creek    2  3rd choice  Rock Creek  Sylvania  Sylvania  Southeast    1  4th choice  Cascade  Southeast  Rock Creek  Sylvania     We will start with Sylvania in the bottom row and move up. They have one point times 14 voters, 2 points times 25 + 10 voters, 3 points times zero, and 4 points times 31 voters. Multiplying and then adding gives us a total of 208 points for Sylvania. You can see the calculation below and we will do the same thing for each campus:     Sylvania: points    Rock Creek: points    Cascade: points    Southwest: points     Using the Borda count method, Rock Creek is the winning location.    Note that Sylvania would have won with the plurality method. Borda count is sometimes described as a consensus-based voting system, since it can be used to choose a more broadly acceptable option over the one with the most first-choice support. This is a different approach than plurality and instant runoff voting that focus on first-choice votes; Borda Count considers every voter's entire ranking to determine the outcome.  Because of this consensus behavior, Borda Count, or some variation of it, is commonly used in awarding sports awards. Variations are used to determine the Most Valuable Player in baseball, to rank teams in NCAA sports, and to award the Heisman trophy.    Pairwise Comparison: Copeland's Method  Another method, called pairwise comparison , the Condorcet method or Copeland's method , attempts to be fair by looking at each pair of candidates separately.  In this method, we look at each pair as if they were the only two candidates running and determine which of the two is more preferred. In Copeland's method, the more preferred candidate is awarded 1 point. If there is a tie, each candidate is awarded point. After all the pairwise comparisons are made, the candidate with the most points, and hence the most pairwise wins, is declared the winner.  Variations of Copeland's Method are used in many professional organizations, including election of the Board of Trustees for the Wikimedia Foundation that runs Wikipedia.    Consider our class president example from the beginning of the chapter. Determine the winner using Copeland's Method.     Number of voters  1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O     We need to look at each pair of candidates to see which would win in a one-to-one comparison. First, we will systematically list all of the pairs of candidates:   Helena vs. Omar    Helena vs. Ana    Ana vs. Omar     Next, comparing Helena with Omar, we see that 6 voters, those marked in bold in the table below, would prefer Helena over Omar. Note that Helena doesn't have to be the voter's first choice – we're imagining that Ana wasn't in the race. The other 4 people chose Omar over Helena.     Number of voters  1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O     Based on this comparison of Helena vs. Omar, Helena wins 1 point.  Next, comparing Helena with Ana, the 6 voters in the last two columns prefer Helena to Ana, so Helena gets one point. Lastly, we compare Ana with Omar. The 1 voter in the first column prefers Ana, as do the 3 voters in the second column. The 3 voters in the third column prefer Omar, but the 3 voters in the last column would choose Ana. So, altogether voters prefer Ana over Omar. Ana gets 1 point.  To summarize, we write how many voters prefer each candidate ignoring all other candidates:   Helena-6 vs Omar-4 (Helena gets 1 point)    Helena-6 vs Ana-4 (Helena gets 1 point)    Ana-7 vs Omar-3 (Ana gets 1 point)     Ana has a total of 1 point and Helena has 2 points, so Helena is the winner under Copeland's Method. This method gave us a different winner than the plurality method where Ana won, because more people preferred Helena to Ana, even though they didn't choose Helena for their first choice.    Now that we've seen an example of each voting method, let's run through each method for the same scenario.    Consider an advertising team voting to choose one of four different slogans, labeled A, B, C and D. Determine the winner using each method we have learned.     Number of voters  5  3  6  4  2    1st choice  D  A  C  B  A    2nd choice  A  C  B  D  D    3rd choice  C  B  A  A  C    4th choice  B  D  D  C  B        Plurality Method: We tally the first-place votes:    A:  B:  C:  D:   C wins the plurality method.   Instant Runoff Method: We start with the plurality tallies. Then we look for the slogan with the least first-choice votes, and that is B. Looking in the preference schedule at the 4 people who voted for B, we see their second choice is D. So we transfer those 4 votes to D, which now has 9.    A:  B:  C:  D:   Now A has the least number of votes with 5, so we look at the voters who chose A for their first choice. There are two columns, so three of those votes will be transferred to C and 2 will be transferred to D.    A:  B:  C:  D:   D is the winner of the instant runoff method.   Borda Count: We add a column on the left for the points, starting with 1 point for last place and counting up. Then we multiply the points by the number of votes and add them all up.     Points  Number of voters  5  3  6  4  2    4  1st choice  D  A  C  B  A    3  2nd choice  A  C  B  D  D    2  3rd choice  C  B  A  A  C    1  4th choice  B  D  D  C  B        A: points    B: points    C: points    D: points     A is the winner of the Borda count method.   Pairwise Comparison:    First we list all the possible pairs:   A vs B    A vs C    A vs D    B vs C    B vs D    C vs D     Then we count the number of voters who would choose each candidate if they were the only two in the race.   A-10 vs B-10    A-14 vs C-6    A-11 vs D-9    B–4 vs C-16    B-13 vs D-7    C-9 vs D-11      Totaling one point for each win and half a point for each tie gives us:   A has 2.5 points    B has 1.5 points    C has 1 point    D has 1 point     A is the winner of the pairwise comparison method.      Which Method is the Most Fair?  To see a very simple example of how difficult voting can be, consider the election below:     Number of voters  5  5  5    1st choice  A  C  B    2nd choice  B  A  C    3rd choice  C  B  A     Notice that in this election: 10 people prefer A to B, 10 people prefer B to C, and 10 people prefer C to A.  No matter whom we choose as the winner, of voters would prefer someone else! This scenario is called Condorcet's Voting Paradox . In this situation, there is no fair resolution. There are many additional paradoxes and fairness criteria that are explained in David Lippman's original version of Math in Society Math in Society: Voting Theory , by David Lippman .  Since it is not possible to have one method that is fair in every situation, it is important to decide which method is the most fair for any given situation.    Primaries and Sequential Voting  For many public offices in the U.S., a sequence of two public votes is held: a primary election and the general election. For non-partisan offices like sheriff and judge, in which political party affiliation is not declared, the primary election is usually used to narrow the field of candidates.  For partisan positions, typically, either the top two candidates receiving the most votes move forward, or the top candidate from each party will move forward. This is called sequential voting - a process in which voters cast totally new ballots after each round of eliminations. Sequential voting has become quite common in television, where it is used in reality shows like The Voice .  In some states a closed primary is used, in which only voters of each party can vote for that party's candidates. In other states, an open primary is used, where voters can pick the party whose primary they want to vote in. In other states, caucuses are used, which are meetings of the political parties, only open to party members. Closed primaries are often disliked by independent voters, who like the flexibility to change which party they are voting in. Open primaries have the disadvantage of raiding, though, where a voter could vote in their non-preferred party's primary with the intent of selecting a weaker opponent for their preferred party's candidate.  Regardless of the primary type, the general election is the main election. While rules vary state-to-state, for an independent or minor party candidate to get listed on the ballot, they typically have to gather a certain number of signatures to petition for inclusion.  In the next section we will look at a different type of election for the President of the United States.

A:  B:  C:  D:  E:   If this was a plurality election, B would be the winner with 8 first-choice votes.     Round 1  We make our first elimination. Choice E has the fewest first-place votes, so we eliminate E from the election. To transfer the 1 vote, we look at the person who voted for E in the last column. Their second choice was D, so we transfer that one vote to D, who will now have 8 votes:    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:     Round 2  There are 24 votes in total, so a majority would be 13 votes. Since no candidate has the majority, we eliminate the next candidate with the fewest votes, which is A. We look at the column for the two people who chose A. Their second choice was E, who is already eliminated. Their third choice is B, so their 2 votes are transferred to B, for a total of 10:    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:     Round 3  Now C has the fewest votes, and there are two columns for C in the preference schedule. Five people who voted for C chose A second, then E (who have already been eliminated), then D. So, we transfer their 5 votes to D. One person who voted for C selected B as their second choice, so their one vote goes to B. Then we tally the votes for each remaining candidate.    A:  B:  C:  D:  E:   Now we can see that D is the winner of the instant runoff method with 13 votes. We can stop this method earlier if a candidate reaches a majority.      "

First, we will systematically list all of the pairs of candidates:   Helena vs. Omar    Helena vs. Ana    Ana vs. Omar     Next, comparing Helena with Omar, we see that 6 voters, those marked in bold in the table below, would prefer Helena over Omar. Note that Helena doesn't have to be the voter's first choice – we're imagining that Ana wasn't in the race. The other 4 people chose Omar over Helena.     Number of voters  1  3  3  3    1st choice  A  A  O  H    2nd choice  O  H  H  A    3rd choice  H  O  A  O     Based on this comparison of Helena vs. Omar, Helena wins 1 point.  Next, comparing Helena with Ana, the 6 voters in the last two columns prefer Helena to Ana, so Helena gets one point. Lastly, we compare Ana with Omar. The 1 voter in the first column prefers Ana, as do the 3 voters in the second column. The 3 voters in the third column prefer Omar, but the 3 voters in the last column would choose Ana. So, altogether voters prefer Ana over Omar. Ana gets 1 point.  To summarize, we write how many voters prefer each candidate ignoring all other candidates:   Helena-6 vs Omar-4 (Helena gets 1 point)    Helena-6 vs Ana-4 (Helena gets 1 point)    Ana-7 vs Omar-3 (Ana gets 1 point)     Ana has a total of 1 point and Helena has 2 points, so Helena is the winner under Copeland's Method. This method gave us a different winner than the plurality method where Ana won, because more people preferred Helena to Ana, even though they didn't choose Helena for their first choice.   "

  "body": " The Popular Vote, Electoral College and Electoral Power     Students will be able to:     Calculate the number of electors per state    Determine the winner of the popular vote    Determine the winner of the electoral college    Calculate the electoral power of each state       Alternative Video Lessons      Choosing the U.S. President  In the last section we talked about equal voting rights and studied several voting methods. To choose the President of the United States, we use another method, called the Electoral College . The Founders, with their newfound freedom from Britain, wanted to create a democracy where citizens could participate in choosing their president. Prior to the Electoral College, there were three options proposed (Best, 2004; Clayton, 2015). They were   Congress would elect the president    State Legislatures would vote and elect the president    The people would elect a president by popular vote     The first option of having Congress do this work was declined as this would alter the balance of power among the three separate branches of government. The idea to have State Legislatures also failed as there wouldn't be the separation between having an independent Federal Government and State Governments.  The popular vote means a candidate must win a plurality of all the votes cast for president, regardless of which state the voters live in. The popular vote was decided against as the Founders didn't think all citizens would be informed enough about the candidates to make an educated decision (Clayton, 2015).  Instead, the Electoral College was decided upon and, in this system, each state was given a certain number of electoral votes. Each state got an equal two votes for the two senate seats. This gave smaller states a leg up as they would have at least these votes. In addition, each state would be given more votes based on their population, equal to their representation in the House (Clayton, 2015). The District of Columbia, which is not a state, also gets 3 electoral votes. A candidate must win a majority of the electoral votes to win the U.S. presidency. If no candidate has a majority of electoral votes then a contingent election would be held by the U.S. House of Representatives between the three candidates with the most electoral votes.  The 4 million U.S. Citizens who live in the U.S. territories of Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico cannot vote in the presidential elections and do not have any electors for the U.S. President. Additionally, there are U.S. Nationals in American Samoa and other territories that cannot vote. You can learn more about residents of these territories in this Census Bureau Report . We will also reiterate that voter suppression still exists and elections will not be truly fair until all of its forms are eliminated.  As stated in the Constitution, the U.S. currently has 435 representatives in the House. They each serve 2-year terms, while the two senators from each state serve 6-year terms.    How many electoral votes are there in the U.S. Electoral College?       By adding all the U.S. Senators, Representatives and 3 for Washington, D.C., we have a total of 538 electoral votes.      How many electoral votes does a candidate need to win to become the President of the United States?     then round up to 270.  A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the U.S. Presidency.      The number of people who voted in the presidential election in 2016 was 136,452,150 (Ballotpedia, n.d.). How many votes would be needed to win a majority of the popular vote?     then round up to 68,226,076.  A candidate would need 68,226,076 votes to win the popular vote.      There were approximately 230,931,921 eligible voters at the time of the 2016 election (McDonald, 2016). What percentage of eligible voters voted?       About 59% of all the eligible voters voted in the 2016 election.    If you are interested in the 2016 election voting rates by race, Hispanic origin and age, you can find them in this Census Bureau Report .    How Electoral Votes are Determined  While each state has a set number of electoral votes based on the formula above, the federal government gave states the control of how they distribute and cast their electoral votes (Paiva, 2011). In 48 states, the candidate with the most votes wins all of that state's electoral votes, often called winner-takes-all . In essence, a candidate could win with barely a majority of the popular vote in that state and the entire state's votes goes to that individual (Clayton, 2015). In 2 states, Maine and Nebraska, however, they use a district plan where instead of winner-takes-all, they use proportionality . This means that they award electoral votes by how individual districts vote. Each district gives their electoral vote to the winner of their district and the remaining two votes go to the candidate that won statewide.  There is a movement to change from the Electoral College to the popular vote. One way this is happening is through the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact . States who adopt this compact agree to award their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. If states and\/or D.C. with at least 270 electoral votes adopt this compact, then the winner of the popular vote would win the electoral college and the presidency. At this time there are 196 electoral votes in states and D.C. who have enacted the bill and the bill has passed one or two legislative houses in additional states with 88 electoral votes.  After citizens cast their votes by mail or on election day on the first Tuesday in November, electors gather in December and are responsible for casting the votes for their state. Electors cannot be elected officials and are chosen by their parties. Electors are expected to vote in alignment with the state they represent, but there have been faithless electors in the past. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in July of 2020 that states can penalize electors who do not vote according to the law of the state.  To see how the electoral college and popular votes work, we will look at a made-up country with a smaller number of states.    Consider this country with 4 states. The rules for the number of senators and electors are the same as the U.S. government. Each state will get 1 representative for every 40,000 residents. For simplicity we will ignore any remainders.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600       Medium  262,340       Large  581,135       Huge  862,070           Determine the number of electors for each state and the total for the country.    How many electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election?    Determine which candidate wins the popular vote and the electoral college vote.    Write down all the possible combinations of states that would win the election based on the electoral college.    What is the fewest number of individual votes needed to win the Electoral College?    What is the smallest percentage of the population that you can win the Electoral College with?          To find the number of electors for each state, we first divide each state population by 40,000 to determine the number of representatives they will have. We will drop the decimal remainders, similar to Hamilton's method.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600       Medium  262,340       Large  581,135       Huge  862,070             State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600  3  2     Medium  262,340  6  2     Large  581,135  14  2     Huge  862,070  34  2      Then we will add the number of representatives and the senators for each state.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600  3  2  5    Medium  262,340  6  2  8    Large  581,135  14  2  16    Huge  862,070  21  2  23    Totals  1,860,145  44  8  52     Now we can add up the total of all the electors from each state and we have:   electors.    To find out how many electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election, we calculate a majority of 65 electors.   , round up to 27  27 electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election in this state    To find the winner for each method, we need the results of an election. In our example, there are 2 candidates for the president, Candidate A and Candidate B. When a candidate wins in a state, they get all the electoral votes for that state. Given the votes for each candidate below, determine who wins the popular vote and who wins the electoral college vote.     State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341      Medium  130,082  132,258      Large  278,177  302,958      Huge  546,555  315,515      Totals         First, we will add up all the votes for each candidate in their columns. Next, we will look at each state individually to determine which candidate wins each state. Candidate B has more votes in Small, Medium and Large, so Candidate B gets all of the electoral votes in those states. Candidate A won Huge, so they get all of those electoral votes. We enter zero for the candidate who does not win in each state. Then we add up the electoral vote columns. Here is the completed table.     State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341  0  5    Medium  130,082  132,258  0  8    Large  278,177  302,958  0  16    Huge  546,555  315,515  23  0    Totals  1,011,073  849,072  23  29     Now we can see that Candidate A wins the popular vote with 1,011,073 votes compared to 849,072 for Candidate B. But Candidate B wins the Electoral College with 29 electoral votes. So, Candidate B becomes the President of the United States.  There have been 5 U.S. presidential elections where the winner of the popular vote was not the winner of the electoral college. In all the other elections, the two methods agreed and would have elected the same candidate.  Try calculating the results if these were the votes instead:     State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341      Medium  131,200  131,140      Large  278,177  302,958      Huge  546,555  315,515      Totals             State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341  0  5    Medium  131,200  131,140  8  0    Large  278,177  302,958  0  16    Huge  546,555  315,515  23  0    Totals  1,012,191  847,954  31  21      This time Candidate A won Medium and Huge. That gave them the electoral vote victory. Note that the race in Medium was very close, and we only changed 1,118 votes or 0.06% of the votes to Candidate A which gave them the Electoral College.  Opponents of the Electoral College system say that it causes candidates to focus on a few swing states, rather than campaigning equally in all states.    Let's look at which combinations of states the candidates could seek to win with.  Since 27 electoral votes are needed, we will list all the winning combinations starting with the smallest number of states to win. We see that a candidate must win either Huge or Large, because Small and Medium together are not enough votes to win     Combination  Small, 5  Medium, 8  Large, 16  Huge, 23  Total    Huge + Small  5    23  28    Huge + Medium   8   23  31    Huge + Large    16  23  39    Huge + Small + Medium  5  8   23  36    Huge + Medium + Large   8  16  23  47    Huge + Small + Large  5   16  23  44    Large + Small + Medium  5  8  16   29    All States  5  8  16  23  52     From the table we find there are 8 different ways to win the electoral college and candidates should definitely campaign in Large and Huge.    To find the fewest number of individual votes a candidate could win with; let's look at the table above. The combination of states with the fewest electoral votes is Huge and Small with 28 electoral votes. Let's see how many votes would be needed to win those two states.  For Huge:   , then round up to 431,036  For Small:   , then round up to 77,301     Let's also consider the next larger combination of 29 electoral votes: winning Small, Large and Medium, because their populations are smaller than the Huge state.  We found above that Small can be won with a bare majority of 77,301 people.  For Medium:   , then round up to 131,171  For Large:   , then round up to 290,568     A candidate can win with 499,040 votes in the combination of the Small, Large and Medium state.    The smallest number of votes to win the electoral college is 499,040. What percentage of the population is that? We will divide by the total population to get     If a candidate had the right combination of states, they could win the Electoral College with only 26.8% of the vote.       People who support the Electoral College often say it protects small states. People who oppose the Electoral College often say that each person's vote should count equally as in the popular vote. Next we will look at electoral power to understand the effect on small states.    Electoral Power   Electoral power is the value of a person's vote in one state compared to another state. A related topic is voting power, which is the probability of any one person influencing an election. If you are interested in voting power, you can look up the Banzhaf Power Index. To calculate the electoral power, we will calculate a ratio of electoral votes for a given number of people. We could use any number, so we will choose the number of people that each representative represents, which is our divisor of 40,000 people.    Using the same fictional country, use the table below to calculate the electoral power of each state.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors  Electoral Votes Per 40,000 people    Small  154,600        Medium  262,340        Large  581,135        Huge  862,070         First, we fill in the number of representatives, senators and electoral votes for each state that we found earlier. Then we will calculate the number of electoral votes per 40,000 people.  To do that, divide the number of electors by the number of representatives, since they each represent approximately 40,000 people. The results are shown in the table below. Note this is approximate because we cut off the decimal remainders when calculating the number of representatives.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors  Electoral Votes Per 40,000 people    Small  154,600  3  2  5     Medium  262,340  6  2  8     Large  581,135  14  2  16     Huge  862,070  21  2  23      Are you surprised to see that the smallest states have the highest electoral power? That is part of the design of the electoral college. The founders from small states were concerned that their votes would not matter, so every state gets 2 senators added to the number of representatives. For a state with few representatives, those 2 extra electoral votes make a big difference. For a large states, the extra 2 electoral votes don't make a very big difference.  You may have noticed a pattern when dividing to find the electoral power. Each time we divided the number of electoral votes by that number minus two. We can write that pattern as . Using GeoGebra to graph that pattern this is what we see.    A cartesian coordinate graph with number of electors on the x-axis and electoral power on the y-axis. The graph shows the maximum electoral power of 3 when there are 3 electors and an exponential decay as the number of electors goes up. With 4 electors the electoral power is 2, with 5 electors the electoral power is about 1.67 and the pattern levels off at an electoral power just over 1.0 as the number of electors increases.    The minimum number of electors is three, since each state gets at least one representative in the apportionment process. The smallest states and Washington, D.C. have 3 electors and the greatest electoral power on the left side of the graph. The largest states like California, Florida and Texas have the least electoral power on the right side of the graph.  Let's say instead each state had equal electoral power by removing the 2 extra electoral votes or by using the popular vote. Then the graph would look like this.    A cartesian coordinate graph with the same axes as the previous graph. This time the electoral power is constant with an electoral power of 1 for every number of electors.    Now that we have studied the popular vote, the Electoral College and electoral power, we leave it up to you to choose which method you think is best.       How is the U.S. President selected?   The president is elected through a process called The Electoral College. States send a certain number of electors, based on their populations, and whichever candidate gets the most votes from these electors becomes president.    How many electors are there in the U.S. Electoral College?   There are 538 electors in the Electoral College.    How many U.S. Senators represent each state?   Two senators represent each state.    What is the length of a term of a U.S. Senator?   The term of a U.S. Senator is 6 years.    How many Representatives serve in the U.S. House of Representatives?   There are 435 Representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives.    What is the length of a term of a U.S. Representative?   The term of a U.S. Representative is 2 years.     In each fictional country in problems 7-10, use the rules of the U.S. government to complete the table and determine the following:     The total number of electors in the state.    The number of electoral votes needed for a majority and win a presidential election.       In this country there is one representative for every 50,000 residents.

  "body": "  Consider this country with 4 states. The rules for the number of senators and electors are the same as the U.S. government. Each state will get 1 representative for every 40,000 residents. For simplicity we will ignore any remainders.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600       Medium  262,340       Large  581,135       Huge  862,070           Determine the number of electors for each state and the total for the country.    How many electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election?    Determine which candidate wins the popular vote and the electoral college vote.    Write down all the possible combinations of states that would win the election based on the electoral college.    What is the fewest number of individual votes needed to win the Electoral College?    What is the smallest percentage of the population that you can win the Electoral College with?          To find the number of electors for each state, we first divide each state population by 40,000 to determine the number of representatives they will have. We will drop the decimal remainders, similar to Hamilton's method.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600       Medium  262,340       Large  581,135       Huge  862,070             State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600  3  2     Medium  262,340  6  2     Large  581,135  14  2     Huge  862,070  34  2      Then we will add the number of representatives and the senators for each state.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors    Small  154,600  3  2  5    Medium  262,340  6  2  8    Large  581,135  14  2  16    Huge  862,070  21  2  23    Totals  1,860,145  44  8  52     Now we can add up the total of all the electors from each state and we have:   electors.    To find out how many electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election, we calculate a majority of 65 electors.   , round up to 27  27 electoral votes are needed to win the presidential election in this state    To find the winner for each method, we need the results of an election. In our example, there are 2 candidates for the president, Candidate A and Candidate B. When a candidate wins in a state, they get all the electoral votes for that state. Given the votes for each candidate below, determine who wins the popular vote and who wins the electoral college vote.     State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341      Medium  130,082  132,258      Large  278,177  302,958      Huge  546,555  315,515      Totals         First, we will add up all the votes for each candidate in their columns. Next, we will look at each state individually to determine which candidate wins each state. Candidate B has more votes in Small, Medium and Large, so Candidate B gets all of the electoral votes in those states. Candidate A won Huge, so they get all of those electoral votes. We enter zero for the candidate who does not win in each state. Then we add up the electoral vote columns. Here is the completed table.     State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341  0  5    Medium  130,082  132,258  0  8    Large  278,177  302,958  0  16    Huge  546,555  315,515  23  0    Totals  1,011,073  849,072  23  29     Now we can see that Candidate A wins the popular vote with 1,011,073 votes compared to 849,072 for Candidate B. But Candidate B wins the Electoral College with 29 electoral votes. So, Candidate B becomes the President of the United States.  There have been 5 U.S. presidential elections where the winner of the popular vote was not the winner of the electoral college. In all the other elections, the two methods agreed and would have elected the same candidate.  Try calculating the results if these were the votes instead:     State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341      Medium  131,200  131,140      Large  278,177  302,958      Huge  546,555  315,515      Totals             State  Votes for Candidate A  Votes for Candidate B  Number of Electoral Votes for A  Number of Electoral Votes for B    Small  56,259  98,341  0  5    Medium  131,200  131,140  8  0    Large  278,177  302,958  0  16    Huge  546,555  315,515  23  0    Totals  1,012,191  847,954  31  21      This time Candidate A won Medium and Huge. That gave them the electoral vote victory. Note that the race in Medium was very close, and we only changed 1,118 votes or 0.06% of the votes to Candidate A which gave them the Electoral College.  Opponents of the Electoral College system say that it causes candidates to focus on a few swing states, rather than campaigning equally in all states.    Let's look at which combinations of states the candidates could seek to win with.  Since 27 electoral votes are needed, we will list all the winning combinations starting with the smallest number of states to win. We see that a candidate must win either Huge or Large, because Small and Medium together are not enough votes to win     Combination  Small, 5  Medium, 8  Large, 16  Huge, 23  Total    Huge + Small  5    23  28    Huge + Medium   8   23  31    Huge + Large    16  23  39    Huge + Small + Medium  5  8   23  36    Huge + Medium + Large   8  16  23  47    Huge + Small + Large  5   16  23  44    Large + Small + Medium  5  8  16   29    All States  5  8  16  23  52     From the table we find there are 8 different ways to win the electoral college and candidates should definitely campaign in Large and Huge.    To find the fewest number of individual votes a candidate could win with; let's look at the table above. The combination of states with the fewest electoral votes is Huge and Small with 28 electoral votes. Let's see how many votes would be needed to win those two states.  For Huge:   , then round up to 431,036  For Small:   , then round up to 77,301     Let's also consider the next larger combination of 29 electoral votes: winning Small, Large and Medium, because their populations are smaller than the Huge state.  We found above that Small can be won with a bare majority of 77,301 people.  For Medium:   , then round up to 131,171  For Large:   , then round up to 290,568     A candidate can win with 499,040 votes in the combination of the Small, Large and Medium state.    The smallest number of votes to win the electoral college is 499,040. What percentage of the population is that? We will divide by the total population to get     If a candidate had the right combination of states, they could win the Electoral College with only 26.8% of the vote.      "

  "body": "  Using the same fictional country, use the table below to calculate the electoral power of each state.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors  Electoral Votes Per 40,000 people    Small  154,600        Medium  262,340        Large  581,135        Huge  862,070         First, we fill in the number of representatives, senators and electoral votes for each state that we found earlier. Then we will calculate the number of electoral votes per 40,000 people.  To do that, divide the number of electors by the number of representatives, since they each represent approximately 40,000 people. The results are shown in the table below. Note this is approximate because we cut off the decimal remainders when calculating the number of representatives.     State  Population  Number of Representatives  Number of Senators  Number of Electors  Electoral Votes Per 40,000 people    Small  154,600  3  2  5     Medium  262,340  6  2  8     Large  581,135  14  2  16     Huge  862,070  21  2  23      Are you surprised to see that the smallest states have the highest electoral power? That is part of the design of the electoral college. The founders from small states were concerned that their votes would not matter, so every state gets 2 senators added to the number of representatives. For a state with few representatives, those 2 extra electoral votes make a big difference. For a large states, the extra 2 electoral votes don't make a very big difference.  You may have noticed a pattern when dividing to find the electoral power. Each time we divided the number of electoral votes by that number minus two. We can write that pattern as . Using GeoGebra to graph that pattern this is what we see.    A cartesian coordinate graph with number of electors on the x-axis and electoral power on the y-axis. The graph shows the maximum electoral power of 3 when there are 3 electors and an exponential decay as the number of electors goes up. With 4 electors the electoral power is 2, with 5 electors the electoral power is about 1.67 and the pattern levels off at an electoral power just over 1.0 as the number of electors increases.    The minimum number of electors is three, since each state gets at least one representative in the apportionment process. The smallest states and Washington, D.C. have 3 electors and the greatest electoral power on the left side of the graph. The largest states like California, Florida and Texas have the least electoral power on the right side of the graph.  Let's say instead each state had equal electoral power by removing the 2 extra electoral votes or by using the popular vote. Then the graph would look like this.    A cartesian coordinate graph with the same axes as the previous graph. This time the electoral power is constant with an electoral power of 1 for every number of electors.    Now that we have studied the popular vote, the Electoral College and electoral power, we leave it up to you to choose which method you think is best.   "

For example, in Oregon we currently have 5 legislative districts as shown in this map Oregon congressional districts by National Atlas of the United States of America is in the Public Domain . After the 2020 census is finished, that number could change. It has been projected that Oregon may get a 6th representative due to population growth from 2010 to 2020.   A map of oregon showing the five legislative districts. District 1 is the Northern Coast and West side of Portland, District 2 is the East side of the state, District 3 is the East side of Portland, District 4 is the Southern Coast and West side of the state, District 5 is the central coast over to Salem and surrounding areas.    After a reapportionment, it is up to each state government to divide their population into equal districts which each elect their representative to the U.S. House. Each representative should represent approximately the same number of people, but their areas may not be the same. Due to different population densities in urban and rural areas, you can see in the map of Oregon that the districts are not geographically equal.  Currently in most states, the state legislature draws the district boundaries. That means the party in power is in charge of drawing the new districts and they could redraw the lines to help their own party. This is called gerrymandering. Gerrymandering , pronounced, Jerrymandering, is when districts are drawn to the political advantage of those drawing the boundaries.   Gerrymandering got its name from Elbridge Gerry, the governor of Massachusetts who signed a bill in 1812 that created the unusual district pictured here that looked like a salamander The Gerry-Mander by Elkanah Tisdale (1771-1835), Originally published in the Boston Centinel, 1812 is in the Public Domain . It gave then Democrat-Republicans a bigger state Senate majority, even though the Federalist party got more votes statewide.   A map of Massachusetts in 1812 showing the unusual district shape with a salamander drawn over it.     Here are some current well-known gerrymanders. This one is called Pennsylvania's Goofy Kicking Donald Duck Pennsylvania US Congressional District 7 (since 2013).tif by Wikimedia Commons contributors, Wikimedia Commons, the free media repository. is in the Public Domain    A map of Pennsylvania with the district shaded in that looks like Goofy kicking Donald Duck.     This one is called Ohio's Lake Erie Monster Ohio US Congressional District 9 (since 2013).tif by Wikimedia Commons contributors, Wikimedia Commons, the free media repository. is in the Public Domain .   A map of Ohio with the district shaded in that is long and thin along Lake Erie that looks like a sea monster.    Gerrymandering has occurred by both parties. Gerrymandering by race is illegal due to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, so people of color cannot be spread out to dilute their vote. Groups with similar interests may want to be put together to form voting blocks, but that is controversial. Gerrymandering by political party has been the subject of many lawsuits and Supreme Court cases. One of the challenges is how to measure gerrymandering to prove that it has occurred. The measurement must be easy to explain and understand in court.  Several ways to measure gerrymandering have been proposed. Some of the first methods used geometry to measure how compact a district is, rather than the sprawling salamander. But it has been shown that being compact does not equate with fairness. More recent methods use computer simulations to determine whether a certain map is an extreme outlier compared to other possible maps, or measure something called partisan bias .  In this book we will focus on the efficiency gap, proposed in 2015 by Nicholas Stephanopoulos and Eric McGhee. The efficiency gap is a measure of the advantage one party has over the other party due to the partisanship of the voters in each district.  Later in this section we will learn how to calculate and interpret the efficiency gap. First, let's look at how we can tell whether a map is fair or not.    Proportionality and Fairness  For a map to be fair, we would expect the portion of seats that a political party wins in an election to be about the same as the portion of that party in the state. This is called proportionality . For example, if a state is 50:50 Democrat to Republican, they should each get about half of the seats. There is nothing in the constitution that guarantees proportionality, but this is a basic measure of fairness. Let's look at a couple of examples using fractions and decimals.   If a state with 6 seats is Republican and Democrat, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?  We will multiply the total number of seats by fraction that each party represents.  Republicans: seats.  Democrats: seats.  In this case the Republicans should have 2 seats and the Democrats should have 4 seats. The numbers won't usually work out so nicely so let's look at another example.     If a state with 8 seats is Republican and Democrat, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?    We will multiply the total number of seats by the decimal portion that each party represents.  Republicans: seats.  Democrats: seats.  By rounding, the most fair combination would be Democrats with 4 seats and Republicans with 4 seats. This is not completely proportional, though, because we can't assign fractions of seats.    Now that we can tell whether a map is fair, let's see how gerrymandering works.    How to Gerrymander  There are two main ways to gerrymander a map, by packing and cracking. Packing is when all the people of one political party are packed into a district. Since a party only needs a plurality or majority to win, all those extra votes would be surplus. Cracking dilutes a party's votes by spreading out the voters so they can't win as many districts.   Here is a small sample map to see how this works. In this fictitious state, we have 35 people and 5 districts. So we will need 7 people in each district. You can see how they are spread out in the map, with Republicans denoted by R's and Democrats marked with D's. To keep it simple, we are only looking at two parties and they will need a majority to win an election. We are also assuming that all voters will vote and that they vote according to their party which may not always be the case.   A simplified state map   A rectangular map with D's and R's spread out to indicate Democrats and Republicans. There are more Democrats concentrated toward the center like a city with more Republicans spread out toward the edges like rural areas.     Before we draw a fair map, let's try gerrymandering it for Democrats and then for the Republicans.      We will first try to advantage the Democrats. There are 7 people in each district, so a party needs 4 votes to win the election. We will draw the lines to put 4 Democrats in each district along with 3 Republicans to spread them out by cracking. Here is our map.  We were able to get 4 Democrats and 3 Republicans in districts 1, 2, 3 and 5. The Republicans will win in district 4 because it will be 5-2, but if the 5th Republican had been in another district, the map would have been more fair. As it is drawn, the population is 17:18 but the seats are 1:4, which does not seem fair.    The map gerrymandered in favor of Democrats   The previous map with district lines drawn. Districts 1, 2, 3 and 5 have 4 Democrats and 3 Republians each. District 4 has 2 Democrats and 5 Rupublicans.         The Efficiency Gap  To try to measure how unfair the map is, let's learn how to calculate the efficiency gap. First, we will tally the votes in the table below, and note how the election results would turn out by using bold numbers for the party with more voters in each district. For example, there are 4 D's and 3 R's in district 1, so the Democrats would theoretically win that district.     District  D Votes  R Votes  D Surplus Votes  R Surplus Vote    1  4  3      2  4  3      3  4  3      4  2  5      5  4  3      Total  18  17       Election Results:   Democrats win 4 seats    Republicans win 1 seat     Next, we will calculate how many votes would be extra over the amount needed to win the election. These are the surplus votes . In this example, with 7 voters, the majority of a district is 4 votes, so we will subtract 4 from each winning side. From each losing side, all of the votes are considered surplus because they did not go toward electing a candidate of their party. Then we add all the surplus votes for each party.     District  D Votes  R Votes  D Surplus Votes  R Surplus Vote    1  4  3   3    2  4  3   3    3  4  3   3    4  2  5  2     5  4  3   3    Total  18  17  2  13     The difference between the surplus votes as a percentage of the population is the efficiency gap. As a formula it is written:     To get a positive result, we put the larger number first and we have   or 31.4%.  The efficiency gap is 31.4%. To understand what this percentage means, we compare it with the percentage that each district represents in the state. Since our state has 5 districts, each one is 20% of the population. Here's how we got that by dividing or as a fraction of the state.   districts , or, or   In this case, the efficiency gap is worth more than one full seat, which suggests that the Democratic party has at least one extra seat than they would with proportional representation.     For another example, we will take the same map and gerrymander it for the Republicans. This time we will pack as many Democrats as we can into the middle, and then use cracking to form the rest of the districts, trying to get 4 R's in as many as we can. Here is the map.   The map gerrymandered in favor of Republicans   The previous map with new district lines drawn. This time Districts 1, 3, 4 and 5 have 4 Republicans and 3 Democrats each. District 2 has 7 Democrats packed in and District 4 has 2 Democrats and 5 Rupublicans.     Now, let's fill in our table:     District  D Votes  R Votes  D Surplus Votes  R Surplus Vote    1  3  4  3     2  7  0   0    3  3  4  3     4  2  5  2     5  3  4  3     Total  18  17  14  1     Election Results:   Democrats win 1 seat    Republicans win 4 seats     To calculate our efficiency gap,   or 37.1%.  This shows the opposite unfairness where the population is 17:18 but the seats are 4:1. We can calculate the number of seats that the efficiency gap is worth by dividing 37.1% by 20%.     The efficiency gap is worth approximately 1.9 seats.  Stephanopoulos and McGhee gave a guideline of around 8% or less for the efficiency gap and this one is 37.1%. The Republicans have at least one extra seat than they would if the seats were proportional to the population.        Now we will try to create a fair map and see what the efficiency gap is. There is an odd number of districts and the population is 17:18 so it might be challenging to make it fair.  With this map, we tried to have two districts that favored Democrats, two that favored Republicans, and one that might go either way. Since there is one extra Democrat, the population is 17:18 and the seats are 2:3    A more fair map   The previous map with new district lines drawn. Districts 2, 3 and 5 have 4 Democrats and 3 Republians each. Districts 1 and 4 have 3 Democrats and 4 Rupublicans each.     Let's see how the efficiency gap comes out in this situation:     District  D Votes  R Votes  D Surplus Votes  R Surplus Vote    1  3  4  3     2  4  3   3    3  4  3   3    4  3  4  3     5  4  3   3    Total  18  17  6  9     Election Results:   Democrats win 3 seats    Republicans win 2 seats     The efficiency gap is   or 8.57%.  This gap is much smaller than in our gerrymandered examples and near the 8% guideline. Due to the odd number of seats and even distribution of the parties, this is as small as we can get the efficiency gap in this situation. It is much less than 20%, which is one seat.     The efficiency gap is worth less than half a seat or about 0.43 seats.    There are still many court cases in progress alleging gerrymandered maps so it seems like a new solution is needed. Some alternatives are appointing independent commissions to draw the lines, or changing the system altogether with proportional representation . The statisticians at FiveThirtyEight used a web application to draw new lines in all of the states according to six different measures. You can read about it in this article .    Exercises   When does redistricting of state districts happen?   Redistricting happens every 10 years after the census is completed. A state might not change its districts unless the number of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives has changed.    Who determines where the district lines are drawn?   Each state government is in charge of drawing the lines.    What are the two rules for drawing district lines?   The rules are districts must be contiguous and you can't gerrymander by race.    What are the two ways to gerrymander?   The two ways to gerrymander are by packing, putting all of one party in a district, or by cracking, splitting up a party into many districts, so their votes are ineffective.    If a state with 7 seats is 62% Republican and 38% Democrat, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?   The most proportional representation would be 4 Republican seats and 3 Democratic seats.    If a state with 12 seats is 43% Republican and 57% Democrat, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?   The most proportional representation would be 5 Republican seats and 7 Democratic seats.    If a state with 3 seats is 4\/5 Republican and 1\/5 Democrat, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?   The most proportional representation would be 2 Republican seats and 1 Democratic seat.    If a state with 9 seats is 3\/8 Republican and 5\/8 Democrat, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?   The most proportional representation would be 3 Republican seats and 6 Democratic seats.    If a state with 11 seats is 52% Republican, 40% Democrat and 8% Green Party, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?   The most proportional representation would be 6 Republican seats, 4 Democratic seats and 1 Green Party seat.    If a state with 18 seats is 31% Republican, 58% Democrat and 11% Progressive Party, how many seats would each party have if the representation was proportional?   The most proportional representation would be 6 Republican seats, 10 Democratic seats and 2 Progressive Party seats.     For each map in problems 11-20, complete the following:     How many votes are needed for a majority?    How many seats are won by each party?    Calculate the efficiency gap.    Calculate the percentage of the state that each district represents.    Calculate how many district seats the efficiency gap is worth.    Explain whether you think the map is fair and why or why not.       This state has 4 districts with 7 people in each district.    A map with 4 districts drawn; Districts 1 has 1 D and 6 R's; District 2 has 3 D's and 4 R's; District 3 has 6 D's and 1 R; District 4 has 7 D's and 0 R's.         A majority is 4 votes.

We studied how to calculate federal income taxes in . In this section we will study where that money goes and what happens when the government spends more than it earns in taxes.   Alternative Video Lessons      Federal Income and Spending  Federal income comes from our individual income taxes and business income taxes. Income is also borrowed by selling savings bonds, notes and Treasury bills (United States Government, 2019). The government has to pay interest on the national debt. After that, there are two types of spending, mandatory and discretionary. Mandatory spending includes Social Security payments, Medicare and other items required by law. Discretionary spending is the amount that Congress budgets annually to fund programs and agencies. Here is a pie chart showing the percentage of spending for each type in 2019. The data comes from the Congressional Budget Office (Congressional Budget Office, 2020).    Pie chart showing mandatory spending (62%), discretionary spending (30%) and net interest (8%) portions of federal spending in fiscal year 2019.      The Federal Budget Process  The Federal Budget is like a home budget, with income and expenses. The U.S. Government's fiscal year goes from October 1st of one year to September 30th of the next year. Work on the budget begins about a year and a half before the budget is finalized.  First, departments and agencies submit their proposals to the White House. Then the President submits their budget plan to Congress. Each chamber of Congress analyzes the proposal and makes their own budget resolution. Then a conference committee of House and Senate members resolves the differences between the two plans and makes a final version that each chamber votes on.  After the budget is passed, the Senate and House Appropriations committees distribute the discretionary part of the funding among 12 subcommittees that oversee different groups of agencies. As before, conference committees meet to merge the two versions of the appropriations bills. All 12 bills must be passed by both the Senate and the House and then signed by the President to enact the new budget.  If any appropriations bill is not signed by September 30th, there is no budget for the new fiscal year. In this case, Congress must pass a continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government. If they do not, or if the president does not sign it, the governement will shut down. The last government shutdown went from December 22, 2018 to January 25, 2019. This was the longest shudown in U.S. history and left over 800,000 federal workers either working without pay or being furloughed at home (Robert, 2020).    The Federal Surplus or Deficit  If the government spends less than it collects in income, there will be a budget surplus for that year. If it spends more than it collects, there will be a deficit for that year. It is also possible to have a balanced budget where the spending equals the income. The federal deficit refers to the budget shortfall in a single time period, like a quarter or a year. For example, in the Fiscal Year 2018, the U.S. deficit was $779 billion. The graph below shows the federal deficit or surplus each year since 1974 using data from the Congressional Budget Office (Congressional Budget Office, 2014).    A bar chart showing the historical and projected federal devicits from 1974 to 2021; The deficits ran from 0 to 500 billion dollars from 1974 to 1996, then there was a budget surplus from 1996 to 2000, then defecits again; The deficits increased to about 1500 billion from 2008 to 2014 and are predected to be less after that.    It is hard to find graphs with a vertical axis in dollars becase the value of the dollar changes over time. One dollar in 1974 could buy a lot more than it can today. In the graph above, each dollar amount is converted to the equivalent of 2013 dollars to account for that. The vertical scale is in billions of 2013 dollars. The largest deficits in 2009 to 2012 were from spending and corporate bailouts to recover from the Great Recession of 2008.  On the graph above, $1 on the vertical scale represents one billion dollars or $1,000,000,000. The highest deficits go down to about -$1,500 billion, which we would write as -$1,500,000,000,000. Here is a chart that shows large numbers and how many zeros they have.     Number  Name    $1,000  One thousand    $1,000,000  One million    $1,000,000,000  One billion    $1,000,000,000,000  One trillion    $1,000,000,000,000,000  One quadrillion    $1,000,000,000,000,000,000  One quintillion     Instead of writing all the zeros, we can abreviate large numbers using decimals. For example, 1,200,000 can be written as 1.2 million. We can write 900,000 as 0.9 million. We can also translate the other way and write 4.567 trillion as 4,567,000,000,000. Note there can be more than one way to write a number. We could write 400,000,000 as either 400 million or 0.4 billion. It is convenient that we put the decimal where the comma goes and vice versa.    Write each number using a decimal abreviation.   4,873,000    1,500,000,000    500,000,000,000    8,300,000       Our method is to find the millions place which is the 7th digit from the right. If the number starts there, use millions. If the number is larger, count 3 more places for billions and 3 more places for trillions.   4,873,000 = 4.873 million    1,500,000,000 = 1.5 billion    500,000,000,000 = 500 billion or 0.5 trillion    8,300,000 = 8.3 million         Write each number in expanded form.   5.7 million    9.22 trillion    100.2 billion    0.25 trillion       Our method is to put a comma where the decimal is and then add zeros to get to the right place value. If the decimal is less than one, we move down to the next lower grouping as shown in part d.   5.7 million = 5,700,000    9.22 trillion = 9,220,000,000,000    100.2 billion = 100,200,000,000    0.25 trillion = 250 billion = 250,000,000,000         Debt to GDP Ratio  A more common way to measure the deficit is as a percentage of the gross domestic product. The gross domestic product , or GDP , is the total value of all the finished goods and services produced within a county's borders in a specific period of time. The GDP is a measure of the size of an economy. The growth rate of the GDP is one measure of a nation's economic health (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2019). The GDP of the United States in 2019 was $21.73 trillion but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a drop in the second quarter of 2020 to $19.74 trillion. (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2020).  Now we can look at more graphs that are written in terms of the percent of GDP. Here is a graph of federal spending and revenues as a percentage of the GDP Federal Revenue and Spending, 1985-2050 is copyrighted by Peter G. Peterson Foundation and used under the permissions granted for educational use. .    Title: The growing debt is caused by a structural mismatch between spending and revenues; There is a line showing the spending from 1984 to 2049 (predicted) and a line showing the revenue in the same years. Most of the time the spending is higher than the revenue, except in the years there was a budget suplus, from 1996 to 2000.    For each year, if we take the revenue and subtract the spending, we get the budget surplus or deficit. If the result is negative it is a deficit. And here is a graph of the deficits in terms of percentage of GDP Updated Budget Projections: 2019 to 2029 by Congressional Budget Office is in the Public Domain. .    Total Deficits and Surpluses; A bar chart that shows the budget deficit or surplus each year as a percentage of GDP.      National Debt  The words deficit and debt are easily confused because they have similar meanings. The deficit is the yearly shortfall, and the national debt is the total cumulative amount of debt held by the government.  As you can see from the previous graphs, most years had a budget deficit. If we add all of those up over time, this is what the national debt looks like Federal Debt: 1791-2019 is copyrighted by Peter G. Peterson Foundation and used under the permissions granted for educational use. .    Title: Debt rises and falls with wars and changes in the economy. Debt is currently higher than it has been at any point since 1948. A bar chart that shows the total national debt from 1794 to 2019; Total debt was highest during the civil war, world war 1 and 2, the great depression and in 2019.    Just like we pay interest on our personal debt, the U.S. pays interest on the national debt. The interest on the debt is expected to keep increasing as shown in this graph Net Interest Cost is copyrighted by Peter G. Peterson Foundation and used under the permissions granted for educational use. .    A graph showing the amount of interest paid on the national debt from 2009 to 2028 (projected after 2017). The amount of interest paid was around 180 billion dollars in 2009 and stayed pretty level until 2017, then was projected to increase steeply to about 900 billion dollars per year in 2028      National Debt Clocks  There are several websites that keep a running total of the national debt. One of them is USDebtClock.org . This one also shows the population, debt per citizen and debt per taxpayer. It shows the spending and deficit with counters that are constantly moving. At the bottom you can also see the debt to GDP ratio compared with previous ratios. The rest of the website shows statistics like the GDP, income tax revenue, median income, unemployment and much more. You can also see statistics for other states and countries.  Now let's do some calculations with these large numbers in the next example.    Here are some approximate values for the U.S. from the Fiscal Year 2018: October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019.   Federal Budget (Spending): $4.407 trillion    Federal Revenue Estimate: $3.422 trillion    National Debt: $21.803 trillion    Interest on the National Debt for 2018: $332.637 billion    Gross Domestic Product: $20.656 trillion    Population: 329 million people        Calculate the budget surplus or deficit for this fiscal year.    Calculate the debt to GDP ratio as a percentage.    How much debt does the U.S. have per person (per capita)?    How much interest is due on the national debt per person?          To calculate the budget surplus or deficit, we subtract the spending from the revenue, and we get:     The result is negative, so there is a deficit of $985 billion. The word deficit indicates that the number is negative. If we wrote a deficit of -$985 billion that would be incorrect because it would be a double negative.    To calculate the debt to GDP ratio, we divide using the order of the wording. For example, the ratio of a to b would be or . So we will take the total amount of national debt and divide it by the GDP:     The debt to GDP ratio is 106%.     Per is another key word for division, so to calculate the debt per capita or per person, we divide the national debt by the population.     Notice that the debt is written in trillions and the population is in millions, so we can't divide these numbers yet. We need to put them into the same units. We can either write both of them in expanded form like this:     Or instead of writing out all the zeros, we can convert one of the numbers to match the other. In this situation it seems easier to convert $21.803 trillion to 21,803,000 million and then divide.       To find out how much interest is due on the national debt per person, we will divide the interest by the population.     Again, the units do not match. This time we will convert the other way and change 329 million people into 0.329 billion people, and we have:     Or you can always write out all the zeros like this and get the same answer.            One advantage of the Debt to GDP ratio is you can compare different countries with economies of different sizes. Let's look at South Korea for comparison. Here are some approximate values, from 2020 (Commodity.com, 2020).   Population: 50.617 million people    National Debt: ₩754.835 trillion    Gross Domestic Product: ₩1.731 quadrillion    Interest Payments per year: ₩30.055 trillion        Calculate the debt to GDP ratio as a percentage.    Calculate the amount of debt per person.    Calculate the amount of interest paid per year per person.          First, we divide the amount of debt by the GDP.     Since one of the numbers is in trillions and the other in quadrillions, we have to make them match before we can divide. We will change the GDP into trillions:       To find the amount of debt per person, we divde the debt by the number of people.     Again the units don't match so we must either write all the zeros or make sure they are in the same units. In this case we will change the debt into millions but there are many ways you could do it.       To find the amount of interest paid per year per person, we divde the amount of interest by the number of people.     We will change the interest to millions and divide.          For more comparisons, here is a graph showing the debt to GDP ratios around the world in 2020 Public Debt Percent GDP World Map by Wikimedia Commons Contributors, Wikimedia Commons, the free media repository. .    World map showing debt to GDP ratios in each country      Pie Charts and Percentages  We can also do calculations with large numbers that involve percentages. We will look at some pie charts related to government income and spending.    In a previous example, we saw that the federal revenue estimate for 2019 was $3.422 trillion. Use the pie chart to calculate the dollar value of each revenue source shown in the graph.    A pie chart showing federal revenue for the United States in the fiscal year 2019; The categories are Income taxes 56%, Social Security taxes 36%, Ad valorem taxes 6% and Business and other taxes 2%.      There are 4 segments in the pie chart, showing 4 different types of revenue. For each type, we will multiply the decimal form of the percentage by the total revenue:  Individual Income Taxes: (0.56)($3.422 trillion) = $1.916 trillion  Social Security Taxes (Payroll Taxes): (0.36)($3.422 trillion) = $1.232 trillion  Corporate Taxes and Other: (.02)($3.422 trillion) = $0.0684 trillion or $68.4 billion  Ad Valorum (Excise Taxes and other): (.06)($3.422 trillion) = $205.3 billion      In a previous example we also saw that the total amount of the federal budget in 2019 was $4.407 trillion. Use the pie chart of federal spending to calculate the dollar amounts of each of the following types of spending.    A pie chart showing Federal Spending for the United States in fiscal year 2019; The categories are pensions 25%, defense 22%, education 3%, health care 28%, interest 8%, wellfare 8%, transportation 2%, protection 1%, general government 1% and other spending 2%       Defense    Social Security Payments    Healthcare    Education       We will take the decimal form of the percentage of each type of spending and multiply it by the total budget amount of $4.407 trillion.   Defense: (0.22)($4.407 trillion) = $0.9695 trillion or $969.5 billion    Social Security: (0.25)($4.407 trillion) = $1.102 trillion    Healthcare: (0.28)($4.407 trillion) = $1.233 trillion    Education: (0.03)($4.407 trillion) = $0.1322 trillion or $132.2 billion       In this chapter, we have looked at many important quantitative aspects of government: apportionment, voting methods, how the president is chosen, gerrymandering and the federal budget. Filling out the census, being informed and voting are extremely important for the U.S. democracy. Please make up your own mind and vote if you are eligible.     Where does the U.S. federal income come from?   Federal income comes from individual income taxes and business income taxes.    What are the two types of federal spending?   The two types of federal spending are mandatory and discretional spending.    How many appropriations bills must be passed to approve the new federal budget?   Twelve appropriations bills must be passed to approve the new federal budget.    When is the deadline for the new budget to be approved?   The deadline for the new budget is September 30th each year.    What is the difference between federal deficit and debt?   A deficit is a shortfall in a single year and debt is the total of all the money owed.    What is the Gross Domestic Product?   The Gross Domestic Product is the total of all the finished goods and services produced by a country in a specific period of time.

  "body": "  In a previous example we also saw that the total amount of the federal budget in 2019 was $4.407 trillion. Use the pie chart of federal spending to calculate the dollar amounts of each of the following types of spending.    A pie chart showing Federal Spending for the United States in fiscal year 2019; The categories are pensions 25%, defense 22%, education 3%, health care 28%, interest 8%, wellfare 8%, transportation 2%, protection 1%, general government 1% and other spending 2%       Defense    Social Security Payments    Healthcare    Education       We will take the decimal form of the percentage of each type of spending and multiply it by the total budget amount of $4.407 trillion.   Defense: (0.22)($4.407 trillion) = $0.9695 trillion or $969.5 billion    Social Security: (0.25)($4.407 trillion) = $1.102 trillion    Healthcare: (0.28)($4.407 trillion) = $1.233 trillion    Education: (0.03)($4.407 trillion) = $0.1322 trillion or $132.2 billion      "

The goal of this book and course is for you to feel more comfortable and confident with mathematical tools that are applicable to your life now and in the future. We will work with proportions for scaling and comparing quantities and financial tools for managing money and taxes. We will also work with statistics for decisions that involve data, probability for decisions with uncertain events, and methods for fair group decision-making like apportionment and voting systems. By practicing with these tools, you'll be better equipped and feel more empowered to use mathematical tools to help you make decisions in college and beyond.  In this chapter we’ll learn several different tools for making decisions. We’ll look at a problem solving structure, percentages, rates and proportions for comparisons, and logic, sets and Venn diagrams for grouping information.   Alternative Video Lesson      A Problem Solving Process  This section may be review for you, and it may present math in a different light that is more concrete and applied than math you have had previously. Our goal is to examine math problems that are relevant to your life where you can apply your lived experience. Some of these problems involve a trade-off or more than one right answer. First, we will outline a problem solving process and see how number sense and operation sense ties into the process. Then we will use percentages to compare quantities.  There are many ways to write a problem solving process, so this is just one example. Some of the important elements are breaking down complex issues into manageable parts, following a logical reasoning process, and using creativity to consider all the possibilities. In real life, problem solving is often an iterative process so evaluation and refinement are important elements as well.   A Problem Solving Process     Identify the question(s) you’re trying to answer. Do any research needed to understand the context. Estimate the range of reasonable answers.    Identify the information you have and any information you may need. Look up or estimate any missing information.    Brainstorm and try out different mathematical tools to see what might be helpful. Use manipulatives, visuals or tables whenever possible. All ideas are useful, even if they don’t work out.    Choose one method to continue and get a potential solution.    Check whether your solution makes sense. Is it reasonable? Can you get there a different way to confirm your answer? Return to Steps 1-5 as needed. When finished, explain your conclusion.      Let's illustrate this process using an example of a decision you may need to make.    You’re comparing two healthcare plans to select one of them for the next year. Plan A has a $200 monthly premium and a $1000 deductible, and plan B has a $150 monthly premium and a $2400 deductible. Which plan is more cost effective and why?  There are many ways to approach a problem like this, so this is an example. Please feel free to try it on your own first before you click on or read our solution. In the online version we have a solution link for each step to reveal one step at a time. You'll see that we go through the steps more than once.    Step 1: The question, context and estimation  The question we need to answer is which plan is cheaper overall. We also need to make sure we understand all the insurance vocabulary used here.  A premium is the amount paid for the health insurance plan (usually monthly) and does not go toward any healthcare used.  A deductible is the amount that a customer must pay of their healthcare used before the insurance company will start paying.   We estimate the yearly cost to be in the thousands for each plan. If we got an amount less than a thousand or more then $10,000 we would be surprised and double check our work.    Step 2: The information  We are given the monthly premiums and deductibles for each plan. We will assume this is for one person. Most plans have a separate deductible for each person so making this decision for a family could be an extension of this problem. You might also need to know how much you usually spend on healthcare per year. We will proceed without this for now and return to this step if it becomes relevant. Let's restate the information we have:   Plan A:   Premium: $200 per month    Deductible: $1000 per year     Plan B:   Premium: $150 per month    Deductible: $2400 per year        Step 3: Consider possible methods  We could compare the two plans on a yearly basis, monthly basis, or make a table.    Step 4: Choose a method to continue  Let’s try calculating the cost of each plan per year.    Plan A:   months per year for premiums.  Then add for the deductible.  The total cost is per year.    Plan B:   months per year for premiums.  Then add for the deductible.  The total cost is per year.    So Plan A is cheaper, right? Well, we bet you are thinking it depends.    Step 5: Check for a reasonable answer  We double checked our math and total amount for each plan is within our original estimate. The totals are not too large or too small to make sense. However, there is another factor to consider. What if you don't use your whole deductible in a year? We noticed that the premiums alone are cheaper for Plan B, so if no healthcare is used during a year then Plan B would be cheaper.    Step 2 Again: Estimate missing information  You could look back at your records and determine how much you usually spend on healthcare each year (the amount billed to insurance). You would also want to consider whether anything might be different in the coming year.    Step 3 Again: Consider possible methods  We could try some values to see which plan was cheaper, and even find the billed amount that switches from Plan B being cheaper to Plan A being cheaper. In order to do this in a systematic way, we will make a table. It might be very useful to get a sense of the range of values where each plan is more cost effective.    Step 4 Again: Choose a method to continue  To make a table, we will start with $0 in billed healthcare and go up from there. To be more efficient, we will start with increments of $200 and go smaller if needed. A spreadsheet would also be a great tool for this. We will learn about and use spreadsheets in the financial math chapter.  To fill in our table we will use the same calculation we did before and combine the two steps into one. For $0 in billed healthcare we have this calculation for each plan.    Plan A:       Plan B:       Continuing that for each healthcare amount, we fill in this table:    Healthcare Billed  Plan A  Plan B    $0  $2400  $1800    $200  $2600  $2000    $400  $2800  $2200    $600  $3000  $2400    $800  $3200  $2600    $1000  $3400  $2800    $1200  $3400  $3000    $1400  $3400  $3200    $1600  $3400  $3400    $1800  $3400  $3600    $2000  $3400  $3800      Step 5 Again: Check for a reasonable answer and explain the conclusion  We completed the table and noticed some patterns that help us verify that our values are correct. Each value goes up by $200 per row, until the deductible is met. We also marked the cheaper option in each row in bold and found the row where both plans are the same.  Now we can see that Plan B starts out cheaper from $0 to $1600 in healthcare cost. They are equal at $1600 and Plan A saves you money after $1600. Having this full picture can help you choose what is best for you in the coming year. If you estimate you will have less than $1600 in billed healthcare, then it would be cheaper to select Plan B. If you think it is more likely you will have more than $1600 in the coming year, then Plan A would be cheaper. This decision has an element of risk or uncertainty and we will learn additional tools to work with that in the probability chapter.      Operation Sense  In the problem we just did, notice what came intuitively to you. Did you have a sense for which plan would be cheaper? Did you intuitively know that we would use multiplication and addition? These operations are common in totalling values. They also make positive values larger. Operation sense is understanding what mathematical operations do and when to use them. There are many words and phrases that translate to certain operations and results in math. In this class you’ll be practicing your operation sense to determine what steps to take.  In this table we list some words and phrases that can indicate each operation, and what will happen as a result. Here we focus on operations with positive numbers, but some of our problems may use negative quantities as well. As an extension, see if you can explain why we get the results from each operation (especially multiplication and division) and what would happen with negative numbers.    Operation  Key phrases  Result    Addition  Add, total, sum, increased by, together, altogether, all together, how many in all, plus, combined, both, and  When adding positive numbers, the answer is larger than the numbers being added.    Subtraction  Minus, subtract, difference, change in, decreased by, fewer than, lost, reduced by, spent, remain, take away, how many are left, need, less  Subtracting a positive number from another gives a smaller result.    Multiplication  Times, double, triple, each group, every, multiply by, area, volume, factor of, product of, of, by, total for repeated patterns with per  Multiplying positive numbers larger than one makes the result larger. Multiplying a positive number by a positive number less than one makes it smaller.    Division  Per, percent, rate, divide, out of, over, average, ratio of, quotient, how many in each, half, quarter, other fraction words  Dividing a positive number by a positive number larger than one makes the result smaller. Dividing a positive number by a positive number less than one makes it bigger.      Determine which operation(s) you would use for each situation. There may be more than one correct answer.   How many dollars of your paycheck you have left to spend.    The amount of sugar you need if you are cutting a recipe in half.    The number of tables you need for a large event.    How much you've spent on streaming services in the last two years.          To calculate what you have left, you would subtract what you've already spent from your paycheck amount. You may need to use addition to total what you've already spent.    To cut a recipe in half, we would either divide by 2 or multiply by one half.    To calculate the number of tables, we would divide the number of guests by the number of seats at each table.    To calculate the total spent on streaming services, we would likely multiply the monthly amount by the number of months. If there were multiple services we would add them together.         Number Sense and Estimation  Another skill you have or are building is number sense . This has to do with understanding the size or magnitude of numbers, and patterns or relationships between numbers. A very useful tool when problem solving is using your number sense to estimate the result. Before you start, how large or small do you expect the answer to be? Would it be positive or negative? Do you expect a number less than one, or in the tens, thousands or millions? It is very important to come back at the end of a problem and use your number sense to make sure your answer seems reasonable.    Estimate a reasonable range of values for each situation.   The weight of a stack of paving stones in the back of an SUV.    The number of people who can fit in a standard elevator.    The total revenue for one showing of a movie at a theater.    The number of scales on a fish.       We haven't given many details here, so there is a wide range of possible answers. Sometimes it is more useful to think of answers that would not make sense.   The weight would be positive and we think it would have to be less than a couple thousand pounds.    The number of people would be 0 to maybe 20, depending on the size of the elevator.    The movie revenue would be between $0 and a few thousand. Of course this depends on the size of the theater.    Without looking it up, we think it would be in the thousands or maybe ten-thousands. Of course it depends on the type and size of the fish, but we don't think it would be in the hundred-thousands or millions.       Now that we have gone through an example using the problem solving process and talked about operations and number sense, we will continue with more mathematical tools to use in making decisions. We will focus the rest of this section on problem solving with percentages and absolute and relative change.    Percents  If you went shopping and one shirt was $20 off and another shirt was $30 off it might be hard to tell which is the better value. What if they were 20% off and 30% off? Percentages can make quantities easier to compare.  Percent, denoted by %, means “per 100,” or “parts per hundred.” In Spanish it’s literally por ciento. When we write 30% off, that means you save 30 out of every 100 dollars. We can write this percentage as the fraction . When we divide 30 by 100, we get We can also say you would save 30 cents out of every dollar. Many equivalent fractions can be written that equal 30%. Notice that 60 out of 200 and 15 out of 50 are also 30%, since    As an example, let’s compare two shirts on sale and add some prices:   Shirt 1:   Original Price: $80    Sale: $20 off     Shirt 2:   Original Price: $100    Sale: 30% off      What is the sale price and sale percentage for each shirt? Which is the better buy?    Shirt 1:  For this shirt we have the dollar amount of the sale so we will subtract it from the original price.   .  Now we will divide to find the percentage of the sale: .  This shirt is 25% off and the sale price is $60.    Shirt 2:  For this shirt we know the percentage off so we need to find 30% of $100. We used a base of 100 so $30 off per $100 is $30.   .  Then we subtract the sale amount from the original price to get: .  This shirt is 30% off and the sale price is $70.    Which shirt do you think is the better deal? You would save more with shirt 2, but shirt 1 is cheaper.     Converting Between Percentages and Decimals  To convert a percentage to decimal form, we use the definition of \"per 100.\" For example, means 82 per 100 so we divide by 100 or move the decimal two places to the left and remove the % symbol.   To go the other way, if we have , we can multiply it by 100% or move the decimal two places to the right and add the % symbol.     Change each percentage into decimal form.   65%    200%    5.2%    0.1%           . Notice this is the same as moving the decimal to the left two places.     or just .     . If we use the method of moving the decimal two places to the left we use a zero to hold the place value and we get 0.052.     .         Change each fraction or decimal into percentage form.        1.25    0.06    0.003          First we divide to get and then multiply by 100%. .     or moving the decimal two places to the right gives 125%.     or moving the decimal two places to the right gives 6%.     or moving the decimal two places to the right gives 0.3%. Note this is less than one percent.         Calculating Percents  When calculating percents, we divide the part by the whole amount. The whole amount is also called the base of the percentage. First we will look at how to calculate percents and then how to calculate a part.   Calculating Percents          We can also think of these formulas as sentences. The word is means equals, per means divide, and of often means multiplication. So we can also say, Percent is part per whole, and, Part is percent of whole.     In a survey of 1,031 randomly chosen adults, 577 said they would feel better if they got more sleep ( source ). What percent is this?    First, we need to identify the part and the whole. The whole is the total number of adults surveyed. The part is the 577 adults who said they would feel better if they got more sleep.  Using the formula we can calculate: .  About 57% of the adults surveyed said they would feel better if they got more sleep.      First estimate which quantity is the larger percentage. Then calculate both percentages.   A quiz score of 8 out of 10 or 11 out of 15.    A cereal with 2 grams of sugar in a 28 gram serving size or 3 grams of sugar in a 32 gram serving size.          We are estimating that 8 out of 10 seems larger compared to 11 out of 15 because missing 2 out of 10 seems like less than 4 out of 15.   .   .  The score of 8 out of 10 is a higher percentage.    We are estimating that 3 out of 32 is a higher percentage than 2 out of 28 because the added gram of sugar seems high compared with only a 4 gram increase in serving size.   .   .  The cereal with 3 grams of sugar out of 32 grams has a higher percentage of sugar.       Another useful tool is finding the part when we know the percentage and the whole amount.    For example, say you have a high yield online savings account that pays an annual interest rate of 4.5%. If you have $3000 in the account for your emergency fund, how much interest will you earn in a year? What would your total balance be with the interest?    To perform calculations with percents, we change them into decimal form first. So we divide 4.5 by 100 or move the decimal two places to the left and we get 0.045.  Then, using the formula we have:   .  You would earn $135 in interest. Interest is added to your account so we will add to find the total balance.   . Your total balance is $3,135 after one year.    Note, most interest is compounded daily or monthly so we simplified the example above. We will come back to this and learn how to calculate compound interest in the financial math chapter.    Find each part described and the total or ending amount.   A smartphone's battery life of 12 hours decreased by 20% after a year of use. Find the amount it decreased by and the current battery life.    The sales tax in Vancouver, Washington is currently 8.7%. How much tax would you pay on TV that costs $399 and what is the total price?          First we will find 20% of 12 hours by multiplying by the decimal form of the percentage: Then we will subtract since the battery life went down. . The phone battery life went down by 2.4 hours to 9.6 hours.    We will find 8.7% of $399 by multiplying the amount by the decimal form of the percentage: We rounded to the nearest cent. Then we will add since the tax is an additional cost. The tax on the TV is $34.71, which gives a total price of $433.71.       There is an optional shorter way to go about this type of problem if you are interested.  If we look at a 20% decrease as the battery retaining 80% of its life (100-20=80)%, we can calculate the new battery life directly:   We can also do this with the TV price using addition for an increase (100+8.7=108.7)%:         Absolute and Relative Change  As we saw in the shirt sale prices, we can talk about a difference in absolute terms or relative terms. Absolute change is the actual amount of the change in dollars, people, etc. The change is positive if the value goes up or negative if it goes down. Relative change is the amount of change as a percentage of the starting amount.  For example, Portland Community College recently increased its tution from $128 to $133 per credit hour. The absolute change is the dollar increase of The relative change is or about 3.9%.   Absolute and Relative Change      The base of a percentage is very important and relative change is calculated as a percentage of the original amount because that was the amount before the change.    Maria has been thinking about selling her car. The value went from $7400 to $6800 over the last year. What is the absolute and relative change in the car's value?    First we will subtract to calculate the absolute change: The absolute change is a decrease of $600.  Now we can calculate the relative change:   The relative change in the price of the car was a decrease of about 8.1%.    Notice in the last example we either used the negative sign or the word decrease to show the direction of the change. We could say the car's value changed by -8.1% or decreased by 8.1%. We wouldn't use both at the same time because that would be a double negative. Let's look at another example.    After raises, Iryna's wage went from $22 to $25 per hour. Sundar's hourly wage went from $19 to $21.85. Calculate their absolute and relative raises. Who got a larger absolute raise? Who got a larger relative raise?    First we will calculate the absolute raises:    Iryna:   .    Sundar:   .    Iryna got a larger absolute raise of $3 per hour compared with $2.85 for Sundar. Now we will calculate the relative raises.     .  Iryna's raise was about 13.6% of her pay.     .  Sundar's raise was 15% of his pay.    Sundar had a relative raise of 15% of his pay and Iryna's raise was about 13.6% of her pay. Iryna had the larger absolute raise but Sundar had the larger raise relative to their starting wages.      Multiple Percent Changes  We can also calculate values with multiple percent increases and decreases. We must be careful here because the base changes each time. For example, if a stock price drops by 60% in one week and increases by 75% the next week, this is not the same as an increase of 15%. The base for the drop is the original price and the base for the increase is the price after the drop. Let's look at this more closely in the next example.    A stock valued at $100 dropped in value by 60% one week, then increased in value the next week by 75%. Is the value higher or lower than where it started? What is the ending value and what is the relative change?    After one week, the value dropped by 60%:   In the next week, notice that base of the percent has changed to the new value of $40. Computing the 75% increase:   In the end, the stock is $70, which is $30 lower, or 30% lower than it started.  This is optional, but if you enjoyed the shorter method we showed before, you can also use it in multi-step percentage problems.

  "body": "  You’re comparing two healthcare plans to select one of them for the next year. Plan A has a $200 monthly premium and a $1000 deductible, and plan B has a $150 monthly premium and a $2400 deductible. Which plan is more cost effective and why?  There are many ways to approach a problem like this, so this is an example. Please feel free to try it on your own first before you click on or read our solution. In the online version we have a solution link for each step to reveal one step at a time. You'll see that we go through the steps more than once.    Step 1: The question, context and estimation  The question we need to answer is which plan is cheaper overall. We also need to make sure we understand all the insurance vocabulary used here.  A premium is the amount paid for the health insurance plan (usually monthly) and does not go toward any healthcare used.  A deductible is the amount that a customer must pay of their healthcare used before the insurance company will start paying.   We estimate the yearly cost to be in the thousands for each plan. If we got an amount less than a thousand or more then $10,000 we would be surprised and double check our work.    Step 2: The information  We are given the monthly premiums and deductibles for each plan. We will assume this is for one person. Most plans have a separate deductible for each person so making this decision for a family could be an extension of this problem. You might also need to know how much you usually spend on healthcare per year. We will proceed without this for now and return to this step if it becomes relevant. Let's restate the information we have:   Plan A:   Premium: $200 per month    Deductible: $1000 per year     Plan B:   Premium: $150 per month    Deductible: $2400 per year        Step 3: Consider possible methods  We could compare the two plans on a yearly basis, monthly basis, or make a table.    Step 4: Choose a method to continue  Let’s try calculating the cost of each plan per year.    Plan A:   months per year for premiums.  Then add for the deductible.  The total cost is per year.    Plan B:   months per year for premiums.  Then add for the deductible.  The total cost is per year.    So Plan A is cheaper, right? Well, we bet you are thinking it depends.    Step 5: Check for a reasonable answer  We double checked our math and total amount for each plan is within our original estimate. The totals are not too large or too small to make sense. However, there is another factor to consider. What if you don't use your whole deductible in a year? We noticed that the premiums alone are cheaper for Plan B, so if no healthcare is used during a year then Plan B would be cheaper.    Step 2 Again: Estimate missing information  You could look back at your records and determine how much you usually spend on healthcare each year (the amount billed to insurance). You would also want to consider whether anything might be different in the coming year.    Step 3 Again: Consider possible methods  We could try some values to see which plan was cheaper, and even find the billed amount that switches from Plan B being cheaper to Plan A being cheaper. In order to do this in a systematic way, we will make a table. It might be very useful to get a sense of the range of values where each plan is more cost effective.    Step 4 Again: Choose a method to continue  To make a table, we will start with $0 in billed healthcare and go up from there. To be more efficient, we will start with increments of $200 and go smaller if needed. A spreadsheet would also be a great tool for this. We will learn about and use spreadsheets in the financial math chapter.  To fill in our table we will use the same calculation we did before and combine the two steps into one. For $0 in billed healthcare we have this calculation for each plan.    Plan A:       Plan B:       Continuing that for each healthcare amount, we fill in this table:    Healthcare Billed  Plan A  Plan B    $0  $2400  $1800    $200  $2600  $2000    $400  $2800  $2200    $600  $3000  $2400    $800  $3200  $2600    $1000  $3400  $2800    $1200  $3400  $3000    $1400  $3400  $3200    $1600  $3400  $3400    $1800  $3400  $3600    $2000  $3400  $3800      Step 5 Again: Check for a reasonable answer and explain the conclusion  We completed the table and noticed some patterns that help us verify that our values are correct. Each value goes up by $200 per row, until the deductible is met. We also marked the cheaper option in each row in bold and found the row where both plans are the same.  Now we can see that Plan B starts out cheaper from $0 to $1600 in healthcare cost. They are equal at $1600 and Plan A saves you money after $1600. Having this full picture can help you choose what is best for you in the coming year. If you estimate you will have less than $1600 in billed healthcare, then it would be cheaper to select Plan B. If you think it is more likely you will have more than $1600 in the coming year, then Plan A would be cheaper. This decision has an element of risk or uncertainty and we will learn additional tools to work with that in the probability chapter.   "

We saw the words per, ratio, and rate in the operation words that indicate division.   Ratios, Rates and Unit Rates  When comparing two like quantities with division, we use a ratio . An example of this is a teacher to student ratio of 1 to 25. There are no units on the 1 or 25 because they are both people. When comparing two unlike quantities, we use a rate . If you traveled 15 miles to class and it took half an hour, that's a rate of 15 miles per half hour. We usually refer to speed in miles per hour or mph, so we can also transform that rate into 30 miles per hour and that is a unit rate .   Ratios and Rates  A ratio is a comparison between two like quantities using division. We often use the word to, a colon or division bar without units.  A rate is a comparison of two unlike quantities using division. We often use the word per or a division bar in the units.  A unit rate is a rate where the denominator is one unit.     Identify each quantity as a ratio, rate, or unit rate:   2:5    $3.98 per gallon                    2 to 5 is a ratio.    $3.98 per gallon is a unit rate.     is a rate, but not a unit rate.     is a ratio.         Proportional Quantities      Which of the following are proportional?                          There are many ways to approach proportional problems, and we will show you three ways. Some methods may work better in particular situations and according to your preference. We will solve proportion problems visually, using a rate and with a proportion equation.

  "body": " Logic in Everyday Life   Logic in Everyday Life   Students will be able to:     Identify propositions    Compose and interpret the negation of a statement    Use logical connectors (and\/or) and conditional statements (if, then) in context    Evaluate the truth value of compound statements in context    Determine whether statements are logically equivalent       Alternative Video Lesson      Logic   Logic is the study of reasoning. Our goal in this chapter is to examine arguments to determine their validity and soundness. In this section we will look at propositions and logical connectors that are the building blocks of arguments. We will also use truth tables to help us examine complex statements.    Propositions  A proposition is a complete sentence that is either true or false. Opinions can be propositions, but questions or phrases cannot.    Which of the following are propositions?   I am reading a math book.    Math is fun!    Do you like turtles?    My cat       The first and second items are propositions. The third one is a question and the fourth is a phrase, so they are not. We are not concerned right now about whether a statement is true or false. We will come back to that later when we examine full arguments.    Arguments are made of one or more propositions (called premises ), along with a conclusion . Propositions may be negated , or combined with connectors like “and”, and “or”. Let's take a closer look at how these negations and logical connectors are used to create more complex statements.    Negation (not)  One way to change a proposition is to use its negation , or opposite meaning. We often use the word not to negate a statement.    Write the negation of the following propositions.   I am reading a math book.    Math is fun!    The sky is not green.    Cars have wheels.          Negation: I am not reading a math book.    Negation: Math is not fun!    Negation: The sky is green (or not not green).    Negation: Cars do not have wheels.         Negation of All and None  It is worth mentioning these qualifiers and how to negate them. If we were to make the statement, All students read this book, we could negate it by saying Not all students read this book. or Some students don't read this book. Notice how this is very different from No students read this book.   If we were to negate, No students read this book, we could say, A student is reading this book, or even, Some students do read this book. It only takes one counterexample to negate an all or nothing statement and the phrases some do and some don't are often used for this purpose. The same concept applies to similar words like everyone, nobody, always and never.    Write two different negations of each statement.   All college students take psychology.    Dogs are never brown.          Negations: Not all college students take psychology, or, Some college students don't take psychology.    Negations: There are brown dogs, or, Some dogs are brown.         Multiple Negations  It is possible to use more than one negation in a statement. If you've ever said something like, I can't not go, you are saying you will go. In fact, it's often used for emphasis or a slightly different meaning, that you really must go. If someone says, I don't disagree , they may be saying they don't exactly agree but the person has a point. A double negative is similar to multiplying two negative numbers which gives a positive result. Using a third negation would then be equivalent to a single negation.  Note that in some instances a negation word like no,  nobody, or nothing is used to emphasize rather than negate and this is called negative concord . For example, I ain't got no money, is not a double negative but rather an emphasis of not having any money. This is common across many varieties of English and other languages. You can read more about negative concord at this site . In general, use your judgment and context cues to distinguish between a double negative and negative concord. We will use multiple negations but not negative concord in this book.  In the media and in ballot measures we often see multiple negations and it can be confusing to figure out what a statement means.    Read the statement and determine the outcome of a yes vote.   Vote for this measure to repeal the ban on plastic bags.     If you said that a yes vote would enable plastic bag usage, you are correct. The ban stopped plastic bag usage, so to repeal the ban would allow it again. This measure has a double negation and is also not very good for the environment.      Read the statement and determine the outcome on mandatory minimum sentencing.   The bill that overturned the ban on mandatory minimum sentencing was vetoed.     In this case mandatory minimum sentencing would not be allowed. The ban would stop it, and the bill to overturn it was vetoed. This is an example of a triple negation.      Logical Connectors: and and or  When we use the word and between two propositions, it connects them to create a new statement that is also a proposition. For example, if you said To finish this project, I need a screwdriver and a wrench, then you are expressing the need for both tools. For an and statement to be true, the connected propositions must both be true. If even one proposition is false (for instance, you didn't need a wrench) then the entire connected statement is false.  The word or between two propositions similarly connects the propositions to create a new statement. In this case, if you said To finish this project, I need a screwdriver or a wrench, then you are expressing the need for one of the tools (but probably not both). For an or statement to be true, at least one of the propositions must be true (or both could be true).    Determine whether each compound statement is true or false.   Guitars have strings and cats do not have whiskers.    Guitars have strings or cats do not have whiskers.    Whales are not mammals and spiders have ten legs.    Whales are not mammals or spiders have ten legs.    Six is an even number and Salem is the capital of Oregon.    Six is an even number or Salem is the capital of Oregon.          False. Guitars have strings but cats do have whiskers. Both statements must be true for an and statement to be true.    True. Since one of the parts is true, the or statement is true.    False. Whales are mammals and spiders have eight legs, so both parts are false, making the and statement false.    False. Neither of the parts are true, so the or statement is false.    True. Six is even and Salem is the capital of Oregon. Since both parts are true, the and statement is true.    True. Since both parts are true, the or statement is true.         Exclusive vs. Inclusive Or  In English we often mean for or to be exclusive : one or the other, but not both. In math, however, or is usually inclusive : one or the other, or both. The thing we are including, or excluding is the both option.    Determine whether each or statement is inclusive or exclusive.   Would you like a chicken or vegan meal?    We want to hire someone who speaks Spanish or Chinese.    Are you going to wear sandals or tennis shoes?    Are you going to visit Thailand or Vietnam on your trip?       The first or statement is a choice of one or the other, but not both, so it is exclusive. The second statement is inclusive because they could find a candidate who speaks both languages. The third statement is exclusive because you can't wear both at the same time. The fourth statement is inclusive because you could visit both countries on your trip.      Conditional Statements: if, then  A conditional statement connects two propositions with if, then . An example of a conditional statement would be If it is raining, then we'll go to the mall. The first part (the if part) is called the hypothesis and the second part (the then part) is called the conclusion .  The statement, It is raining, may be true or false for any given day. If the condition is true, then we will follow the course of action and go to the mall. If the condition is false, though, we haven't said anything about what we will or won't do.  To understand the truth values for a conditional statement it is helpful to look at an example. Let's say a friend tells you, If you post that photo to Facebook, you'll lose your job. Under what conditions can you say that your friend was wrong?  There are four possible outcomes:   You post the photo and lose your job    You post the photo and don't lose your job    You don't post the photo and lose your job    You don't post the photo and don't lose your job     The only case where you can say your friend was wrong is the second case, in which you post the photo but still keep your job.  Your friend didn't say anything about what would happen if you didn't post the photo, so you can't say the last two statements are wrong. Even if you didn't post the photo and lost your job anyway, your friend never said that you were guaranteed to keep your job if you didn't post it.  In this case it can be useful to outline the possibilities and outcomes in a table. The four cases above correspond to the four rows of the truth table. For this table we will use P for posting the photo, and L for losing your job.     Posting the Photo (P)  Losing Your Job (L)  If P , then L    You post the photo (T)  You lose your job (T)  True    You post the photo (T)  You don't lose your job (F)  False    You don't post the photo (F)  You lose your job (T)  True    You don't post the photo (F)  You don't lose your job (F)  True     If the hypothesis (the if part) is false, we cannot say that the statement is a lie, so the result of the third and fourth rows is true. Notice that we are using a double negation in this explanation.    Determine whether each conditional statement is true or false.   If tricycles have three wheels, then bicycles have two wheels.    If tricycles have three wheels, then tricycles can fly.    If pigs can fly, then birds can fly.    If pigs can fly, then the sky is yellow.          True. Tricycles have three wheels and bicycles have two wheels. The hypothesis and conclusion are both true, so the statement is true.    False. Tricycles have three wheels, but they cannot fly. The hypothesis is true but the conclusion is false, making the statement false.    True. Pigs cannot fly (on their own) but birds can. Since the hypothesis is false, the statement is true regardless of whether the conclusion is true or false.    True. Since the hypothesis is false, the statement is true regardless of whether the conclusion is true or false.         Evaluating Compound Statements  Some situations combine many if, then , and or or statements that may be inclusive or exclusive. Here's an example where we need to evaluate a complex statement.    Determine which set(s) of qualificaitons meet the requirement: To apply for this job, applicants must have a bachelor's degree, an associate's degree and 3 years of relevant experience, or a high school diploma or GED and 6 years of relevant experience.    Lyssa has a bachelor's degree and 2 years of relevant experience.    Jordan has a high school diploma and 3 years of relevant experience.    Ayan has an associate's degree and 6 years of relevant experience.    Sylvia has a GED and 6 years of relevant experience.       There are many combinations that work here. Lyssa, Ayan and Sylvia all meet the requirements or go beyond what is needed. Jordan does not have enough years of experience to go with a high school diploma for this job.    We are using the words and, or, not and if then in this book, but if you look up other resources on logic you are likely to see these symbols.   Symbols used in other resources   is written    is written    may be written as ~ or    is written      Logical Equivalence  And and or statments can have their propositions reversed without affecting the truth value of the statement. If you need to buy bacon and eggs, that's the same as buying eggs and bacon. The order does matter for a conditional statement, though. Sometimes during an argument, an if, then statement will be reversed or combined with not in different ways. There are names for the combinations and it is helpful to look at which statements are equivalent to each other. Here are the names for the different combinations of an if, then and not statements.      Original Conditional : if p, then q     Converse : if q, then p     Inverse : if not p, then not q     Contrapositive : if not q, then not p     Let's look at all of the possibilities in an example.    Assume this original conditional statement is true: If you take your dog to the park, they will be happy. Write the converse, inverse and contrapositive of the original statement and determine which are equivalent to each other.       Converse: If your dog is happy, then you took them to the park. Notice we needed to change the tense to keep the order of events the same. If your dog is happy does that mean you took them to the park? Not necessarily, because there are other reasons your dog could be happy like getting a treat or taking a walk. So this is false.    Inverse: If you don't take your dog to the park, they will not be happy. This is similar to the converse. Even if you don't take your dog to the park, they could be happy for another reason. This is false. The inverse is logically equivalent to the converse.    Contrapositive: If your dog is not happy, then you did not take them to the park. Since the original statement is true, then this is also true. Taking your dog to the park would result in them being happy, so if they are not happy we can say that they did not go to the park. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.       Let's summarize the results in this box.   Logical Equivalence  A conditional statement and its contrapositive are equivalent.  The converse and inverse of a conditional statement are equivalent.

Notice we needed to change the tense to keep the order of events the same. If your dog is happy does that mean you took them to the park? Not necessarily, because there are other reasons your dog could be happy like getting a treat or taking a walk. So this is false.    Inverse: If you don't take your dog to the park, they will not be happy. This is similar to the converse. Even if you don't take your dog to the park, they could be happy for another reason. This is false. The inverse is logically equivalent to the converse.    Contrapositive: If your dog is not happy, then you did not take them to the park.

In this section, we will use sets and Venn diagrams to visualize relationships between groups and represent survey data.  A set is a collection of items or things. Each item in a set is called a member or an element .      The numbers 2 and 42 are elements of the set of all even numbers.    MTH 105 is a member of the set of all courses you are taking.      A set consisting entirely of elements of another set is called a subset . For instance, the set of numbers 2, 6, and 10 is a subset of the set of all even numbers.  Some sets, like the set of even numbers, can be defined by simply describing their contents. We can also define a set by listing its elements using set notation .    Set Notation   Set notation is used to define the contents of a set. Sets are usually named using a capital letter, and its elements are listed once inside a set of curly brackets.  For example, to write the set of primary colors using set notation, we could name the set C for colors, and list the names of the primary colors in brackets: C = {red, yellow, blue} . In this case, the set C is a subset of all colors. If we wanted to write the list of our favorite foods using set notation, we could write F = {cheese, raspberries, wine} . And yes, wine is definitely an element of some food group!    Julia, Keenan, Jae and Colin took a test. They got the following scores: 70, 95, 85 and 70. Let P be the set of test takers and S be the set of test scores. List the elements of each set using set notation.    In this example, the set of people taking the test is P = {Julia, Keenan, Jae, Colin}, and the set of test scores is S = {70, 85, 95}. Notice in this example that even though two people scored a 70 on the test, the score of 70 is only listed once.    It is important to note that when we write the elements of a set in set notation, there is no order implied. For example, the set {1, 2, 3} is equivalent to the set {3, 1, 2}. It is conventional, however, to list the elements in order if there is one.    Universal Set  The universal set is the set containing every possible element of the described context. Every set is therefore a subset of the universal set. The universal set is often illustrated by a rectangle labeled with a capital letter U . Subsets of the universal set are usually illustrated with circles for simplicity, but other shapes can be used.       If you are searching for books for a research project, the universal set might be all the books in the library, and the books in the library that are relevant to your research project would be a subset of the universal set.   A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U, labeled all books in the library; there is a circle inside the rectangle, labeled books relevant to your research project.       If you are wanting to create a group of your Facebook friends that are coworkers, the universal set would be all your Facebook friends and the group of coworkers would be a subset of the universal set.   A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U, labeled all your facebook friends; there is a circle inside the rectangle, labeled coworkers.       If you are working with sets of numbers, the universal set might be all whole numbers, and all prime numbers would be a subset of the universal set.   A rectangle is drawn for the universal set U, labeled all whole numbers; there is a circle inside the rectangle, labeled all whole numbers.          The Null Set  It is possible to have a set with nothing in it. This set called the null set or empty set . It's like going to the grocery store to buy your favorite foods and realizing you left your wallet at home. You walk away with an empty bag. The set of items that you bought at the grocery store would written in set notation as G = { } , or G = Ø .    Intersection, Union, and Complement (And, Or, Not)  Suppose you and your roommate decide to have a house party, and you each invite your circle, or set, of friends. When you combine your two sets of friends, you discover that you have some friends in common.  The set of friends that you have in common is called the intersection . The intersection of two sets contains only the elements that are in both sets. To be in the intersection of set A and B , an element needs to be in both set A  and set B .  The set of all friends that you and your roommate have invited is called the union . The union of two sets contains all the elements contained in either set (or both). To be in the union of set A and set B , an element must to be contained in just set A , just set B , or in the intersection of sets A and B . Notice that in this case that the or is inclusive.  What about the people who were not invited to the party and showed up anyway? They are not elements of your set of invited friends. Nor are they an element of your roommate's set of invited friends. These uninvited party crashers are the complement to your set of invited friends. The complement of a set A contains everything that is not in the set A . To be in the complement of set A , an element cannot be in set A , but it will be an element of the universal set.    Consider the sets: A = {red, green, blue}, B = {red, yellow, orange}, and C = {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple}   Determine the set A intersect B , and write it in set notation.    Determine the set A union B , and write it in set notation.    Determine the intersection of A complement and C and write it in set notation.          The intersection contains the elements in both sets: A intersect B = {red}    The union contains all the elements in either set: A union B = {red, green, blue, yellow, orange}. Notice we only list red once.    Here we are looking for all the elements that are not in set A and are in set C : A complement intersect C = {orange, yellow, purple}         Venn Diagrams   Venn diagrams are used to illustrate the relationships between two or more sets. To create a Venn diagram, start by drawing a rectangle to represent the universal set. Next draw and label overlapping circles to represent each of your sets. Most often there will be two or three sets illustrated in a Venn diagram. Finally, if you are given elements, fill in each region with its corresponding elements. Venn diagrams are also a great way to illustrate intersections, unions and complements of sets as shown below.    The intersection is where the shading of the two sets overlaps in the center. It contains the elements of A and B.   A Venn diagram of two overlapping sets, labeled set A and set B, with 3 regions; the crescent shape in yellow indicates the region for members who are only in set A; the crescent shape shaded blue indicates the members who are only in set B; the overlapping region in the middle is shaded green to indicate member in both sets; the green area is called the intersection     The union includes all elements of A or B or both. It contains all three of the shaded regions.   The same Venn diagram used to illustrate the union is all 3 regions     The complement of set A includes all the elements not in A. It is the shaded region outside the set of A, but within the universal set.   A Venn diagram with only one set A; The region outside the circle for A but inside the rectangle is shaded blue to represent the complement of the set or elements not in set A.     Here is an example of how to draw a Venn Diagram.    Let J be the set of books Julio read this summer and let R be the set of books Rose read this summer. Draw a Venn diagram to show the sets of books they read if Julio read Game of Thrones, Animal Farm and 1984, and Rose read The Hobbit, 1984, The Tipping Point, and Greek Love.  To create a Venn diagram showing the relationship between the set of books Julio read and the set of books Rose read, first draw a rectangle to illustrate the universal set of all books.  Next draw two overlapping circles, one for the set of books Julio read and one for the set of books Rose read. Since both Rose and Julio read 1984, we place it in the overlapping region (the intersection).  All the books that Rose read will lie in her circle, in one of the two regions that make up her set. Likewise for the books Julio read. Since we have already filled in the overlapping region, we put the books that only Rose read in her circle's cresent moon section, and we put the books that only Julio read in his circle's cresent moon section. The resulting diagram is shown below.    A Venn diagram with 2 overlapping sets, one for Rose and one for Julio; The books that only rose read are in her crescent: The Hobbit, The tipping Point, and Greek Love; The books that only Julio read are in his crescent: Game of Thrones and Animal Farm; the books they both read are in the center region: 1984.       In the last section we discussed the difference between inclusive or and exclusive or. In common language, or is usually exclusive, meaning the set A or B includes just A or just B but not both. In logic, however, or is inclusive, so the set A or B includes just A , just B , or both. The difference between the inclusive and exclusive or can be illustrated in a Venn, as shown below.    A previous generic Venn diagram showing 2 ovelapping sets, set A and set B. The yellow crescent is labeled Just A, the blue crescent is labeled Just B, and the green intersection is labeled A and B. The inclusive or includes all 3 regions; the exclusive or is just the yellow and blue regions.       Illustrating Data  We can also use Venn diagrams to illustrate quantities, data, or frequencies.    A survey asks 200 people, What beverage(s) do you drink in the morning? and offers three choices: tea only, coffee only, and both coffee and tea. Thirty report drinking only tea in the morning, 80 report drinking only coffee in the morning, and 40 report drinking both. How many people drink tea in the morning? How many people drink neither tea nor coffee?    To answer this question, let's first create a Venn diagram representing the survey results. Placing the given values, we have the following:    A Venn diagram with 2 overlapping sets, labeled coffee and tea; There are 80 people in the crescent for only coffee only, 30 people in the crescent for only tea, and 40 in the overlapping region in the center for coffee and tea    The universal set should include all 200 people surveyed, but we only have 150 placed so far. The difference between what we have placed so far, and the 200 total is the number of people who drink neither coffee nor tea. These 200 – 150 = 50 people are placed outside of the circles but within the rectangle since they are still included in the universal set.  The number of people who drink tea in the morning includes everyone in the tea circle. This includes those who only drink tea and those who drink both tea and coffee. Thus, the number of people who drink tea is 40 + 30 = 70.    The same Venn digram with the number 50 placed outside of the circles and inside the universal set. These are the people who don't drink tea or coffee      Here is an example of a Venn diagram with three sets.    In a survey, adults were asked how they travel to work. Below is the recorded data on how many people took the bus, biked, and\/or drove to work. Draw and label a Venn diagram using the information in the table.    Travel Options  Frequency    Just Car  157    Just Bike  20    Just Bus  35    Car and Bike only  35    Car and Bus only  10    Bus and Bike only  8    Car, Bus and Bike  12    Neither Car, Bus nor Bike  15    Total  292      To fill in the Venn diagram, we will place the 157 people who only drive a car in the car set where it does not overlap with any other modes of transportation. We can fill in the numbers 20 and 35 in a similar way.  Then we have the overlap of two modes of transportation only. There are 35 people who use their car and bike only, so they go in the overlap of those two sets, but they do not take the bus, so they are outside of the bus set. Similarly, we can enter the 10 and 8. There are 12 people who use all three modes, so they are in the intersection of all three sets. There are 15 people who do not use any of the three modes, so they are placed outside the circles but inside the universal set of all modes of transportation. Here is the completed Venn diagram.    A Venn diagram with 3 overlapping circles labeled bus, car and bike; The numbers are places as in the text: bus only, 35; car only, 57; bike only, 20; bus and car only, 10, bus and bike only, 8; bike and car only, 35; the center region for all 3 modes of transportation has 12. The region outside the circles has 15 people        One hundred fifty people were surveyed and asked if they believed in UFOs, ghosts, and Bigfoot. The following results were recorded.   43 believed in UFOs    44 believed in ghosts    25 believed in Bigfoot    10 believed in UFOs and ghosts    8 believed in ghosts and Bigfoot    5 believed in UFOs and Bigfoot    2 believed in all three     Draw and label a Venn diagram to determine how many people believed in at least two of these things.    Starting with the intersection of all three circles, we work our way out. The number in the center is 2, since two people believe in UFO's, ghosts and Bigfoot. Since 10 people believe in UFOs and Ghosts, and that includes the 2 that believe in all three, that leaves 8 that believe in only UFOs and Ghosts.  We work our way out, filling in all the regions. Once we have, we can add up all those regions, getting 91 people in the union of all three sets. This leaves 150 – 91 = 59 who believe in none.    A Venn diagram with 3 overlapping circles labeled bigfoot, UFO's and ghosts; The numbers are places as in the text: bigfoot only, 14; UFO's only, 30; ghosts only, 28; bigfooot and UFO's only, 3; bigfoot and ghosts only, 6; UFO's and ghosts only, 8; the center region overlapping all 3 has 2. The region outside the circles has 59 people    Then to answer the question of how many people believed in at least two (two or more), we add up the numbers in the intersections, 8 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 19 people.      Qualified Propositions  A qualified proposition is a statement that asserts a relationship between two sets. The three relationships we will be looking at in this section are some (some elements are shared between the two sets), none (none of the elements are shared between the two sets), and all (all elements of one set are contained in the other set). These relationships are especially important in evaluating arguments.    Overlapping Sets  Sets overlap if they have members in common. The Venn diagram examples we have looked at in this section are overlapping sets.     The set of students living in SE Portland and the set of students taking MTH 105.  Qualified Proposition: Some students who live in SE Portland take MTH 105.     A set diagram showing 2 overlapping sets, students in SE portland and students in Math 105; the overlapping region is students who live in SE and are taking Math 105; the rectangle is labeled with U for the universal set       Disjoint Sets  Sets are disjoint if they have no members in common.     The set of Cats and the set of Dogs.  Qualified Proposition: No cats are Dogs.     A set diagram showing 2 sets that are entirely separate, cats and dogs. The circles do not overlap but they are in the universal set rectangle       Subsets  If a set is completely contained in another set, it is called a subset .     The set of all Trees and the set of Maples Trees.  Qualified Proposition: All Maples are Trees.     A set diagram showing the circle for the set maple trees inside the circle for the set of trees. Both are inside the universal rectangle, U       Exercises   List the elements of the set The letters of the word Mississippi.    {m, i, s, p}    List the elements of the set Months of the year.    {January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December}    Write a verbal description of the set {3, 6, 9}.   The set containing multiples of 3 from 3 to 9    Write a verbal description of the set {a, i, e, o, u}.   The set containing vowels    Is {1, 3, 5} a subset of the set of odd numbers?   Yes, {1, 3, 5} a subset of the set of odd numbers.    Is {A, B, C} a subset of the set of letters of the alphabet?   Yes, {A, B, C} a subset of the set of letters of the alphabet.     Create a Venn diagram to illustrate each of the following:    A survey was given asking whether people watch movies at home from Netflix, Redbox, or Disney+. Use the results to determine how many people use Redbox.    only use Netflix, only use Redbox     only use Disney+, use only Disney+ and Redbox     use only Netflix and Redbox, use only Disney+ and Netflix     use all three, use none of these           A survey asked buyers whether color, size, or brand influenced their choice of cell phone. The results are below. How many people were influenced by brand?    said only color, said only size     said only brand, said only color and size     said only color and brand, said only size and brand     said all three, said none of these           Use the given information to complete a Venn diagram, then determine: a) how many students have seen exactly one of these movies, and b) how many have seen only Star Wars Episode IX.    have seen Inception (I) , have seen Star Wars Episode IX (SW)      have seen Vanilla Sky (VS) , have seen I and SW      have seen VS and SW , have seen I and VS      have seen all three     have seen none of these            Twenty-four students have seen exactly one of these movies.    Nineteen students have only seen Star Wars Episode IX.       A survey asked 100 people what alternative transportation modes they use. Use the data to complete a Venn diagram, then determine: a) what percentage of people only ride the bus, and b) how many people don't use any alternate transportation.   40 use the bus, 25 ride a bicycle, and 33 walk    7 use the bus and ride a bicycle    15 ride a bicycle and walk, 20 use the bus and walk    5 use all three modes of alternate transportation            18% of the people (eighteen people) only ride the bus.    Thirty-nine people don't use any alternate transportation.         Given the qualified propositions:   Determine the two sets being described.    Determine if the sets described are Subsets, Overlapping Sets or Disjoint sets.    illustrate the situation using sets.       All Terriers are dogs.      Terriers and dogs    Subsets            Some Mammals Swim. (The second set is not clearly defined but is implied)      Mammals and Things that swim    Overlapping            No pigs can fly.      Pigs and things that can fly    Disjoint            All children are young.      Children and people that are young    Subset            Some friends remember your birthday.      There are at least two ways this can be interpreted. Friends and people that remember your birthday OR friends and friends that remember my birthday.    Overlapping or subset (depending on how this is interpreted)               No lies are truths.      Lies and truths    disjoint             Suppose someone wants to conduct a study to learn how teenage employment rates differ among gender identities and honor roll status. For each teenager in the study, they will need to record the answers to these three questions:   How does the teenager identify their gender?    Is the teenager an honor student or not?    Is the teenager employed or not?     Explain what each of the regions in the following Venn Diagram represent.         Region A:     Region B:     Region C:     Region D:     Region E:     Region F:     Region G:     Region H:            Region A: Unemployed non-honor-students who identify as boys    Region B: Unemployed honor-students who identify as boys    Region C: Unemployed honor-students who identify as girls or nonbinary    Region D: Employed non-honor-students who identify as boys    Region E: Employed honor-students who identify as boys    Region F: Employed honor-students who identify as girls or nonbinary    Region G: Employed non-honor-students who identify as girls or nonbinary    Region H: Unemployed non-honor-students who identify as girls or nonbinary       Students were surveyed to see if they used smart phones, tablets, or both.   85 students said they used smart phones    50 students said they used tablets    10 students said they use both    5 students said they used neither     Draw a Venn Diagram to help you answer the following. Show your calculations.  How many students were surveyed?       130 students were surveyed.    The Venn Diagram below shows the numbers of students in grade 5 at an elementary school who have enrolled for keyboard (K), guitar (G), and drum classes. Fill in the blanks         Students enrolled for keyboard class:     Students enrolled for keyboard class only:     Students didn't enroll at all:     Students took all three classes:     Students enrolled for guitar and drum:     Students enrolled for guitar and drum only:            Students enrolled for keyboard class: 24    Students enrolled for keyboard class only: 8    Students didn't enroll at all: 6    Students took all three classes: 4    Students enrolled for guitar and drum: 6    Students enrolled for guitar and drum only: 2       A poll asked 100 coffee drinkers whether they like cream or sugar in their coffee. The information was organized in the following Venn Diagram.             How many coffee drinkers like cream?    How many coffee drinkers like sugar?    How many coffee drinkers like sugar but not cream?    How many coffee drinkers like cream but not sugar?    How many coffee drinkers like cream and sugar?    How many coffee drinkers like cream or sugar?    How many coffee drinkers like neither cream nor sugar?           Thirty-six coffee drinkers like cream.    Fifty-five coffee drinkers like sugar.    Thirty-five coffee drinkers like sugar but not cream.    Sixteen coffee drinkers like cream but not sugar.    Twenty coffee drinkers like cream and sugar.    Seventy-one coffee drinkers like cream or sugar.    Twenty-nine coffee drinkers like neither cream nor sugar.       110 dogs were asked Why do you like to eat garbage?    89 said It tastes great!     87 said It's more filling!     68 said It tastes great! and It's more filling!         Draw a Venn diagram to represent this information    How many said It's more filling! but didn't say It tastes great! ?    How many said neither of those things?    How many said It's more filling! or said It tastes great               Nineteen said It's more filling! but didn't say It tastes great!     Forty-two said neither of those things.    108 said It's more filling! or said It tastes great!        "

Draw a Venn diagram to show the sets of books they read if Julio read Game of Thrones, Animal Farm and 1984, and Rose read The Hobbit, 1984, The Tipping Point, and Greek Love.  To create a Venn diagram showing the relationship between the set of books Julio read and the set of books Rose read, first draw a rectangle to illustrate the universal set of all books.  Next draw two overlapping circles, one for the set of books Julio read and one for the set of books Rose read. Since both Rose and Julio read 1984, we place it in the overlapping region (the intersection).  All the books that Rose read will lie in her circle, in one of the two regions that make up her set. Likewise for the books Julio read. Since we have already filled in the overlapping region, we put the books that only Rose read in her circle's cresent moon section, and we put the books that only Julio read in his circle's cresent moon section. The resulting diagram is shown below.    A Venn diagram with 2 overlapping sets, one for Rose and one for Julio; The books that only rose read are in her crescent: The Hobbit, The tipping Point, and Greek Love; The books that only Julio read are in his crescent: Game of Thrones and Animal Farm; the books they both read are in the center region: 1984.

Thirty report drinking only tea in the morning, 80 report drinking only coffee in the morning, and 40 report drinking both. How many people drink tea in the morning? How many people drink neither tea nor coffee?    To answer this question, let's first create a Venn diagram representing the survey results. Placing the given values, we have the following:    A Venn diagram with 2 overlapping sets, labeled coffee and tea; There are 80 people in the crescent for only coffee only, 30 people in the crescent for only tea, and 40 in the overlapping region in the center for coffee and tea    The universal set should include all 200 people surveyed, but we only have 150 placed so far. The difference between what we have placed so far, and the 200 total is the number of people who drink neither coffee nor tea. These 200 – 150 = 50 people are placed outside of the circles but within the rectangle since they are still included in the universal set.  The number of people who drink tea in the morning includes everyone in the tea circle. This includes those who only drink tea and those who drink both tea and coffee. Thus, the number of people who drink tea is 40 + 30 = 70.    The same Venn digram with the number 50 placed outside of the circles and inside the universal set.

There are 35 people who use their car and bike only, so they go in the overlap of those two sets, but they do not take the bus, so they are outside of the bus set. Similarly, we can enter the 10 and 8. There are 12 people who use all three modes, so they are in the intersection of all three sets. There are 15 people who do not use any of the three modes, so they are placed outside the circles but inside the universal set of all modes of transportation. Here is the completed Venn diagram.

Once we have, we can add up all those regions, getting 91 people in the union of all three sets. This leaves 150 – 91 = 59 who believe in none.

  "body": " The Language and Rules of Logic with Truth Tables   The Language and Rules of Logic with Truth Tables   Students will be able to:     Identify propositions    Compose and interpret the negation of a statement    Use logical connectors (and\/or) and conditional statements (if, then)    Use truth tables to find truth values of basic and complex statements      Note: This section begins the same way as, Logic in Everyday Life, but includes truth tables.   Alternative Video Lesson      Logic   Logic is the study of reasoning. Our goal in this chapter is to examine arguments to determine their validity and soundness. In this section we will look at propositions and logical connectors that are the building blocks of arguments. We will also use truth tables to help us examine complex statements.    Propositions  A proposition is a complete sentence that is either true or false. Opinions can be propositions, but questions or phrases cannot.    Which of the following are propositions?   I am reading a math book.    Math is fun!    Do you like turtles?    My cat       The first and second items are propositions. The third one is a question and the fourth is a phrase, so they are not. We are not concerned right now about whether a statement is true or false. We will come back to that later when we examine full arguments.    Arguments are made of one or more propositions (called premises ), along with a conclusion . Propositions may be negated , or combined with connectors like “and”, and “or”. Let's take a closer look at how these negations and logical connectors are used to create more complex statements.    Negation (not)  One way to change a proposition is to use its negation , or opposite meaning. We often use the word not to negate a statement.    Write the negation of the following propositions.   I am reading a math book.    Math is fun!    The sky is not green.    Cars have wheels.          Negation: I am not reading a math book.    Negation: Math is not fun!    Negation: The sky is green (or not not green).    Negation: Cars do not have wheels.         Negation of All and None  It is worth mentioning these qualifiers and how to negate them. If we were to make the statement, All students read this book, we could negate it by saying Not all students read this book. or Some students don't read this book. Notice how this is very different from No students read this book.   If we were to negate, No students read this book, we could say, A student is reading this book, or even, Some students do read this book. It only takes one counterexample to negate an all or nothing statement and the phrases some do and some don't are often used for this purpose. The same concept applies to similar words like everyone, nobody, always and never.    Write two different negations of each statement.   All college students take psychology.    Dogs are never brown.          Negations: Not all college students take psychology, or, Some college students don't take psychology.    Negations: There are brown dogs, or, Some dogs are brown.         Multiple Negations  It is possible to use more than one negation in a statement. If you've ever said something like, I can't not go, you are really saying you must go. It's a lot like multiplying two negative numbers which gives a positive result.  In the media and in ballot measures we often see multiple negations and it can be confusing to figure out what a statement means.    Read the statement and determine the outcome of a yes vote.   Vote for this measure to repeal the ban on plastic bags.     If you said that a yes vote would enable plastic bag usage, you are correct. The ban stopped plastic bag usage, so to repeal the ban would allow it again. This measure has a double negation and is also not very good for the environment.      Read the statement and determine the outcome on mandatory minimum sentencing.   The bill that overturned the ban on mandatory minimum sentencing was vetoed.     In this case mandatory minimum sentencing would not be allowed. The ban would stop it, and the bill to overturn it was vetoed. This is an example of a triple negation.      Logical Connectors (and, or)  When we use the word and between two propositions, it connects them to create a new statement that is also a proposition. For example, if you said To finish this project, I need a screwdriver and a wrench, then you are expressing the need for both tools. For an and statement to be true, the connected propositions must both be true. If even one proposition is false (for instance, you didn't need a wrench) then the entire connected statement is false.  The word or between two propositions similarly connects the propositions to create a new statement. In this case, if you said To finish this project, I need a screwdriver or a wrench, then you are expressing the need for one of the tools (but probably not both). For an or statement to be true, at least one of the propositions must be true (or both could be true).    Exclusive vs. Inclusive or  In English we often mean for or to be exclusive : one or the other, but not both. In math, however, or is usually inclusive : one or the other, or both. The thing we are including, or excluding is the both option.    Determine whether each or statement is inclusive or exclusive.   Would you like a chicken or vegan meal?    We want to hire someone who speaks Spanish or Chinese.    Are you going to wear sandals or tennis shoes?    Are you going to visit Thailand or Vietnam on your trip?       The first or statement is a choice of one or the other, but not both, so it is exclusive. The second statement is inclusive because they could find a candidate who speaks both languages. The third statement is exclusive because you can't wear both at the same time. The fourth statement is inclusive because you could visit both countries on your trip.      Conditional Statements (if, then)  A conditional statement connects two propositions with if, then . An example of a conditional statement would be If it is raining, then we'll go to the mall.   The statement, It is raining, may be true or false for any given day. If the condition is true, then we will follow the course of action and go to the mall. If the condition is false, though, we haven't said anything about what we will or won't do.    Basic Truth Tables  In logic we can use a truth table to analyze a complex statement by summarizing all the possibilities and their truth values (true or false). To do this, we break the statement down to its smallest elements, the propositions. Then we can see the outcome of the complex statement for all possible combinations of true and false for the propositions.  For example, let's work with two propositions:    R : You paid your rent this month.     E : You paid your electric bill this month.     We will use these two propositions to demonstrate the truth tables for not, and, and or.     To set up a truth table, we list all the possible truth value combinations in a systematic way. The standard way of doing this is to make the first column half true, then half false, then cut the pattern in half with each succeeding column. For two propositions, the first two columns are shown to the right.    R  E  R and E    T  T     T  F     F  T     F  F      The four possible combinations are   Row 1: You have paid your rent and electric bill    Row 2: You have paid your rent but not your electric bill    Row 3: You have not paid your rent but you have paid your electric bill    Row 4: You haven't paid either your rent or electric bill (yet).     Once we fill in the starting columns, we add additional columns for the more complex statements. We can add as many columns as needed. Below are the basic truth tables for not, and, and or.    Basic Truth Tables    Not : In the not R column, the truth value is the opposite of the value for R . For example, if R is true (you paid your rent) then not R (you did not pay your rent) is false.    R  not R    T  F    F  T       And : In the R and E column, you must have paid both your rent and electric bill. Otherwise R and E is false.    R  E  R and E    T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  F    F  F  F       Or : In the R or E column, you must have paid either your rent or electric bill, or both (inclusive or). Otherwise R or E is false.    R  E  R or E    T  T  T    T  F  T    F  T  T    F  F  F        Conditional Truth Tables  We talked about conditional statements ( if, then statements), earlier. In logical arguments the first part (the if part) is usually a hypothesis and the second part (the then part) is a conclusion .  To understand the truth table values for a conditional statement it is helpful to look at an example. Let's say a friend tells you, If you post that photo to Facebook, you'll lose your job. Under what conditions can you say that your friend was wrong?  There are four possible outcomes:   You post the photo and lose your job    You post the photo and don't lose your job    You don't post the photo and lose your job    You don't post the photo and don't lose your job     The only case where you can say your friend was wrong is the second case, in which you post the photo but still keep your job.  Your friend didn't say anything about what would happen if you didn't post the photo, so you can't say the last two statements are wrong. Even if you didn't post the photo and lost your job anyway, your friend never said that you were guaranteed to keep your job if you didn't post it.  The four cases above correspond to the four rows of the truth table. For this truth table we will use P for posting the photo, and L for losing your job.     If, then : In the If P, then L column, the only outcome that is false is if you post the photo and don't lose your job. Otherwise If P, then L is true.    P  L  If P , then L    T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  T    F  F  T     If the hypothesis (the if part) is false, we cannot say that the statement is a lie, so the result of the third and fourth rows is true. Notice that we are using a double negation in this explanation.  We are using the words and, or, not and if then in this book, but if you look up other resources on truth tables you are likely to see these symbols.   Symbols used in other resources   is written    is written    may be written as ~ or    is written      Truth Tables for Complex Statements  Truth tables really become useful when we analyze more complex statements. In this case we will have several columns. It helps to work from the inside out and create a column in the table for each intermediate statement.    Create a truth table for the statement A or not B      When we create the truth table, we start with columns for the propositions, A and B . Then we add a column for not B because that is part of the final statement. Our last column is the final statement A or not B .    A  B  not B  A or not B    T  T      T  F      F  T      F  F        To complete the third column, not B , we take the opposite of the B column. Then to complete the fourth column, we only look at the A and the not B columns and compare them using or .    A  B  not B  A or not B    T  T  F  T    T  F  T  T    F  T  F  F    F  F  T  T         Truth Tables with Three Propositions  To create a truth table with three propositions we need eight rows for all the possible combinations. We will first determine the columns we need to get to our final statement. Then we will fill in the first three columns using the same methodology as before. Start with half true, half false, then cut the pattern in half each time.    Create a truth table for the statement A and not (B or C)     First let's figure out the columns we will need. We have A, B, C, then we need the statement in the parentheses, (B or C) . Then we need the negation of that column, not (B or C) . Then we conclude with our final statement, A and not (B or C) .  Here is the initial table:    A  B  C  B or C  not (B or C)  A and not (B or C)    T  T  T       T  T  F       T  F  T       T  F  F       F  T  T       F  T  F       F  F  T       F  F  F       Now we complete the columns one at a time. We use the B column and C column to complete B or C, . Then not (B or C) is the opposite of that column. For the final column we only need to look at the first and fifth columns, shaded in blue, with and . Here is the completed table.    A  B  C  B or C  not (B or C)  A and not (B or C)    T  T  T  T  F  F    T  T  F  T  F  F    T  F  T  T  F  F    T  F  F  F  T  T    F  T  T  T  F  F    F  T  F  T  F  F    F  F  T  T  F  F    F  F  F  F  T  F    For this statement A must be true and neither B or C can be true, so it is only true in the fourth row. For an example of this statement, let's define these propositions in the context of professional baseball:  Let A = Anaheim wins, B = Baltimore wins, C = Cleveland wins.  Suppose that Anaheim will make the playoffs if: (1) Anaheim wins, and (2) neither Boston nor Cleveland wins. TFF is the only scenario in which Anaheim will make the playoffs.      Construct a truth table for the statement if m and not p, then r .    First, it may help to add parentheses to help you clarify the order. Our statement could also be written, if (m and not p), then r . To build this table, we will build the statement in parentheses and then repeat the r column after it. It's easier to read the conditional statement from left to right. Here are the columns for the table:    m  p  r  not p  m and not p  r  If (m and not p), then r    T  T  T        T  T  F        T  F  T        T  F  F        F  T  T        F  T  F        F  F  T        F  F  F        For the fourth column, we take the opposite of p . Then we use the first and fourth columns to complete m and not p . With the r column repeated we can use columns five and six to complete our conditional statement. Here is the completed table:    m  p  r  not p  m and not p  r  If (m and not p), then r    T  T  T  F  F  T  T    T  T  F  F  F  F  T    T  F  T  T  T  T  T    T  F  F  T  T  F  F    F  T  T  F  F  T  T    F  T  F  F  F  F  T    F  F  T  T  F  T  T    F  F  F  T  F  F  T    When m is true, p is false, and r is false—the fourth row of the table—then the hypothesis m and not p will be true, but the conclusion is false, resulting in an invalid conditional statement; every other case gives a true result.  If you want a real-life situation that could be modeled by if m and not p , then r , consider this:  Let m = we order meatballs, p = we order pasta, and r = Ruba is happy.  The statement if m and not p , then r is, if we order meatballs and don't order pasta, then Ruba is happy . If m is true (we order meatballs), p is false (we don't order pasta), and r is false (Ruba is not happy), then the statement is false, because we satisfied the premise, but Ruba did not satisfy the conclusion.    In this section we have discussed propositions, logical connectors and truth tables. In the next section, we will look at set relationships before we analyze arguments.

  "body": " Describing and Critiquing Arguments   Describing and Critiquing Arguments.   Students will be able to:     Understand the structure of logical arguments by identifying the premise(s) and conclusion    Distinguish between inductive and deductive arguments    Make a set diagram to evaluate deductive arguments    Determine whether a deductive argument is valid and\/or sound       Alternative Video Lessons      Logical Arguments  A logical argument is a claim that a set of premises support a conclusion . It is possible for a logical argument to have one or many premises, but there must be one conclusion. In this section we will look at types of arguments and how to determine the strength, validity and\/or soundness of each type. There are two types of arguments we will explore in this section: inductive and deductive arguments.    Inductive and Deductive Arguments  To better understand the difference between inductive and deductive arguments, let's start by looking at a couple of examples.   Consider the following argument:  When I went to the store last week, I forgot my wallet, and I forgot it again when I went back today. I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.  Before we analyze an argument, it is helpful to precisely state its premises and its conclusion. Most arguments you encounter in the real world won't be stated in a precise premise, premise, conclusion form. Sometimes the conclusion will be stated before the premises, or the premises will be hidden within a bunch of rhetoric.  To begin our analysis of this first argument, let's first rewrite it in a more precise premise, premise, conclusion form.  Premise: I forgot my wallet when I went to the store last week.  Premise: I forgot my wallet when I went to the store today.  Conclusion: I always forget my wallet when I go to the store.  Notice that both premises make a claim about a specific instance – the specific instance last week when I forgot my wallet, and the specific instance today when I forgot my wallet. The conclusion, on the other hand, states what we can expect to happen more generally.   Now let's consider a different argument:   Henry must know CPR because he is a nurse and all nurses know CPR.  Just as we did for the last example, let's rewrite the argument in its premise, premise, conclusion form:  Premise: All nurses know CPR.  Premise: Henry is a nurse.  Conclusion: Henry knows CPR.  Unlike the first argument where the premises were specific and the conclusion was general, this argument's first premise is a general statement and the conclusion is specific. We can determine whether an argument is inductive or deductive by looking at which part of the argument is general and which is specific. In the first example, the premises were specific and the conclusion was more general. This is an example of an inductive argument. In the second example, it was the premises that were more general and the conclusion that was specific. This is an example of a deductive argument.   In general, an inductive argument uses a collection of specific examples (i.e. data) as its premises and uses them to propose a general conclusion. This is shown in the image on the left below, where the argument moves from the narrow specific premises at the bottom up to the wide general conclusion at the top. A deductive argument uses a collection of general statements (i.e. definitions) as its premises and uses them to propose a specific conclusion . This is shown in the image to the right below, where the argument moves from the wide general premises at the bottom to the narrow specific conclusion at the top.    A pyramid upside down with the narrow end at the bottom for a specific premise, the middle section is another specific premise; the wide part at the top is for the general conclusion    A pyramid right-side up with the wide base at the bottom for a general premise; another general premise in the middle section, and a specific conclusion in the narrow part at the top      Rewrite the following arguments in a precise “premise, premise, conclusion” form, and determine if the argument is inductive or deductive.   A number is prime if it is only divisible by itself and one. Since the number 13 is only divisible by itself and one, 13 must be prime.    Juan's dog Goober is having puppies. All three of Goober's previous litters have had 5 puppies so Goober is bound to have 5 puppies in this litter as well.          Premise: If a number is only divisible by itself and one, the number is prime.  Premise: The number 13 is only divisible by itself and one.  Conclusion: 13 is prime.  Since the premises are general definitions and properties of numbers and the conclusion is a specific statement about the number 13, the argument is deductive .    Premise: Goober is having puppies.  Premise: Goober's last three litters had 5 puppies.  Conclusion: Goober's current litter will have 5 puppies.  This is an example of an inductive argument since it uses specific experiences\/instances as its premises, and its conclusion is a general expectation based on those specific experiences.         Evaluating Arguments  Inductive arguments cannot be proven. The best we can do is evaluate the strength of the argument based on the evidence it provides.  A strong inductive argument is one that is well supported by its premises, while a weak inductive argument is one whose premises do a poor job of supporting the conclusion. The strength of an inductive argument is subjective, because where one person sees a strong argument, another may see a weak argument. Additionally, the strength and truth of an argument are not necessarily related; it is possible to have a weak argument that is true, and a strong argument that is false.    Determine the strength of the inductive argument.  James Franco, Jodie Foster, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jack Nicholson have all won Academy Awards for acting. Actors whose names start with J are bound to win an Academy Award.    The inductive argument provides a number of specific cases as evidence for the conclusion. However, we would not be surprised if a J-named actor did not win an Academy Award, so the argument is weak.    Deductive arguments, on the other hand, can be proven and their validity and soundness can be evaluated. The validity of the argument is based on whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises, while the soundness of the argument is based on whether or not the premises are true. An argument cannot be sound if it is not valid, even if the premises seem reasonable.    Evaluating Deductive Arguments Using Sets  One way to determine whether a deductive argument is valid is to illustrate the premises of the argument using sets and see if the conclusion logically follows if we assume the premises to be true.    Use a set diagram to determine whether the argument is valid. If the argument is valid, determine if it is also sound.    All cats are mammals and a tiger is a cat, so a tiger is a mammal.      All water bottles are plastic. This is a water bottle, so it must be plastic.      All firefighters know CPR. Jill knows CPR, so Jill must be a firefighter.      None of my friends like dancing. Kai doesn't like dancing. Therefore, Kai is my friend.      Some young adults make minimum wage and Tara is a young adult. Therefore, Tara makes minimum wage.           First let's write the argument in its premise, premise, conclusion form. For the problems we will be looking at, you will want to write the first premise as a qualified proposition (some, none, all) since this will form the basic structure of our diagram.  Premise: All cats are mammals.  Premise: A tiger is a cat.  Conclusion: A tiger is a mammal.  From the first premise we know that all cats lie inside the set of mammals (cats are a subset of mammals). From the second premise, we know that tigers lie inside the set of cats (marked with an X), and therefore also lie within the set of mammals.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of cats contained within the set of mammals. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is an arrow for tigers pointing to the inside of the cats circle    This argument is valid because we were able to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The argument is also sound since the premises all cats are mammals and a tiger is a cat are true.    From the first premise we know that all water bottles lie inside the set of plastic items (water bottles are a subset of plastic). From the second premise, we know that this particular water bottle must lie within the plastic items set.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of water bottles contained within the set of plastic. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is an arrow for this water bottle pointing to the inside of the water bottle circle    This argument is valid because we were able to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. But the argument is not sound because the premise that all water bottles are plastic is not true. There are many versions of glass and metal bottles that are evidence that the first premise is not true. This argument is valid but not sound.    From the first premise we know that all firefighters lie inside the set of those who know CPR (firefighters are a subset of people who know CPR). From the second premise, we know that Jill is a member of the set of those who know CPR, but we do not have enough information to know whether she is also a member of set of firefighters.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of firefighters contained within the set of those who know CPR. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is a question mark inside the firefighter circle and in the larger know CPR region because we don't know which region Jill is in    Since we cannot determine which group Jill must be a part of, the argument is invalid. The statement that Jill is a firefighter does not follow logically from the premises that all firefighters know CPR and that Jill knows CPR . Since the argument is not valid, it cannot be sound.      A set diagram with 2 disjoint sets, people who like to dance and my friends; Both circles are in the universal set rectangle; There is a question mark in the my friends circle and in the region outside the circles because we don't know where Kai goes.    Because it said none we draw disjoint sets – one set for my friends and a second set for people who like to dance. The second premise tells us that Kai doesn't like to dance so they're not in the set of people who like to dance. However, we can't put Kai in the set of my friends either. They could be my friend, or someone I don't know who happens to not like dancing. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid . And therefore, the arguement is also not sound .      A set diagram with 2 overlapping sets, young adults and minimum wage earners; There is a question mark in the young adults region and in the intersection of the two circles because we don't know where Tara goes.    Because it said some we draw overlapping sets. The second premise tells us to put Tara in the set of young adults, but it doesn't tell us if she makes minimum wage or not. So, like the previous example we cannot determine which region she is in. She could make minimum wage, or she could also make more. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid and therefore, not sound .         Exercises   Write whether the argument described is inductive or deductive:     The first five terms of the sequence were all odd, therefore the sixth term will also be odd.    My dog is afraid of loud noises. Today is the fourth of July, so there will be fireworks. My dog will be afraid today.         The argument is inductive.    The argument is deductive.       Find the next term of the sequences below.     3, 6, 9, 12, 15,     3, 6, 9, 15, 24,          The next term is 18.    The next term is 39.        Rewrite each of the following arguments in their premise, premise, conclusion form, and determine whether the argument is inductive or deductive. If the argument is inductive, determine its strength. If the argument is deductive, use sets to illustrate and determine the validity of the argument, and state whether the argument is valid and whether it is sound.    Since all cats are scared of vacuum cleaners and Max is a cat, Max must be scared of vacuum cleaners.   Premise: All cats are scared of vacuum cleaners.  Premise: Max is a cat.  Conclusion: Max must be scared of vacuum cleaners.  This is a deductive argument. It is valid. However, it is not sound because the premise all cats are afraid of vacuum cleaners is false. While many cats are afraid of vacuum cleaners not ALL cats are afraid. There are many videos of cats riding electronic vacuum cleaners.        Every day for the last year, a plane flew over my house at 2 pm. Therefore, a plane will always fly over my house at 2pm.   Premise: Every day for the last year, a plane flew over my house at 2pm.  Conclusion: A plane will always fly over my house at 2pm.  This is an inductive argument. It is a strong argument because a large quantity of data has been collected.    Kiran collected data on the salaries of their friends. They found that female and nonbinary friends made less than male friends, so they concluded that women and nonbinary people make less than men.   Premise: Kiran's female and nonbinary friends made less than Kiran's male friends.  Conclusion: Women and nonbinary people make less than men.  This is an inductive argument. Kiran did not gather a large diverse sample because they only asked their friends. Therefore, their data has sampling bias. This makes their argument weak.    Some of these kids are rude. Jimmy is one of these kids. Therefore, Jimmy is rude!   Premise: Some of these kids are rude.  Premise: Jimmy is one of these kids.  Conclusion: Jimmy is rude!  This is a deductive argument. This argument is not valid. Jimmy could be one of these rude kids, he could also be a kid who is not rude. Because the conclusion is not valid, it is also not sound.        All bicycles have two wheels. My friend's Harley-Davidson has two wheels, so it must be a bicycle.   Premise: All bicycles have two wheels.  Premise: My friend's Harley-Davidson motorcycle has two wheels.  Conclusion: It must be a bicycle.  This is a deductive argument. The argument is not valid. Based on the premises, we know that the friend's Harley-Davidson motorcycle has two wheels, but we do not know whethere or not it is a bicycle. Because it is not valid, it is also not sound.        Since all chocolate contains milk and this bar is made of chocolate, it must contain milk.   Premise: All chocolate contains milk.  Premise: This bar is made of chocolate.  Conclusion: It must contain milk.  This is a deductive argument. The argument is valid. This bar is in the set of chocolate and chocolate is in the set of things that contain milk. However, this conclusion is not sound because not all chocolate contains milk.        All students drink a lot of caffeine. Brayer drinks a lot of caffeine, so he must be a student.   Premise: All students drink a lot of caffeine.  Premise: Brayer drinks a lot of caffeine.  Conclusion: He must be a student.  This is a deductive argument. The argument is not valid. We can not determine if Brayer is a student or not. Because it is not valid it is also not sound.        Over the course of a year, data was collected on the number of students visiting the cafeteria. On average, there were 15-35 students present in the cafeteria during the peak hours of the data. We can expect there to be between 15 and 35 students in the cafeteria if we go during the peak hours of the day.   Premise: Over one year on average, there were 15-35 students present in the cafeteria during the peak hours.  Conclusion: There is going to be between 15 and 35 students in the cafeteria if we go during the peak hours of the day.  This is an inductive argument. This argument is strong because the conclusion is supported by the premises, they gathered a large amount of data over a long period of time on week days.    If a person is on this reality show, they must be self-absorbed. Laura is not self-absorbed. Therefore, Laura cannot be on this reality show.   Premise: People on this reality show are self-absorbed.  Premise: Laura is not self-absorbed.  Conclusion: Laura cannot be on this reality show.  This argument is deductive. The argument is valid because Laura is outside of the set of self-absorbed people, so she must also be outside of this set of people on this reality show. Determining if this conclusion is sound is more difficult because determining if someone is self-absorbed is subjective.        The first few terms of the sequence are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Therefore, the next term will be 11.   This is a strong inductive argument because we are given specific numbers in which we can find a pattern. Then based on that pattern we can determine that the next term of the sequence would be 11.      For each of the following, draw the appropriate illustration of sets (Subset, Disjoint or Overlapping). Then put an X to represent the subject of the conclusion or put two question marks to illustrate the subject could into two locations. Finally, state if the argument is valid and whether it is sound.    Premise: No apples are pears.  Premise: A Pink Lady is an apple.  Conclusion: Therefore, a Pink Lady is not a pear.   The argument is valid and sound.        Premise: All children are young.  Premise: Tamika is young.  Conclusion: Therefore, Tamika is a child.   The argument is not valid, and it is not sound.        Premise: Some goats faint.  Premise: Fizzy faints.  Conclusion: Therefore, Fizzy is a goat.   The argument is not valid, and it is not sound.        Premise: All students who miss more than 25% of class time fail.  Premise: Claudia failed my class.  Conclusion: Claudia missed more than 25% of class time.   This argument is not valid, and because it is not valid it is also not sound. Claudia could have missed 25% of the classes causing her to fail. She could instead be failing because of low test scores.        Premise: All students who miss more than 25% of class time fail.  Premise: Ethan missed more than 25% of class time.  Conclusion: Ethan failed.   This argument is valid, and it is sound. Because Ethan is in the set of folks who missed 25% of the classes he also falls into the set of failing.        Premise: All dogs eat apples.  Premise: Mary ate an apple.  Conclusion: Mary is a dog.   This argument is not valid, and because it is not valid it is also not sound. Mary could be a dog. Mary could also be a worm, horse or human.        Premise: Some entering freshmen have to take a placement test.  Premise: Juan is an entering freshman.  Conclusion: Juan has to take a placement test.   This argument is not valid, and is not sound. We cannot determine if Juan took the test.        Premise: No cats like peanut butter.  Premise: Bob does not like peanut butter.  Conclusion: Bob is a cat.   This argument is not valid. Because it is not valid, it is also not sound. We cannot determine if Bob is a cat or not.         "

  "body": "  Use a set diagram to determine whether the argument is valid. If the argument is valid, determine if it is also sound.    All cats are mammals and a tiger is a cat, so a tiger is a mammal.      All water bottles are plastic. This is a water bottle, so it must be plastic.      All firefighters know CPR. Jill knows CPR, so Jill must be a firefighter.      None of my friends like dancing. Kai doesn't like dancing. Therefore, Kai is my friend.      Some young adults make minimum wage and Tara is a young adult. Therefore, Tara makes minimum wage.           First let's write the argument in its premise, premise, conclusion form. For the problems we will be looking at, you will want to write the first premise as a qualified proposition (some, none, all) since this will form the basic structure of our diagram.  Premise: All cats are mammals.  Premise: A tiger is a cat.  Conclusion: A tiger is a mammal.  From the first premise we know that all cats lie inside the set of mammals (cats are a subset of mammals). From the second premise, we know that tigers lie inside the set of cats (marked with an X), and therefore also lie within the set of mammals.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of cats contained within the set of mammals. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is an arrow for tigers pointing to the inside of the cats circle    This argument is valid because we were able to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The argument is also sound since the premises all cats are mammals and a tiger is a cat are true.    From the first premise we know that all water bottles lie inside the set of plastic items (water bottles are a subset of plastic). From the second premise, we know that this particular water bottle must lie within the plastic items set.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of water bottles contained within the set of plastic. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is an arrow for this water bottle pointing to the inside of the water bottle circle    This argument is valid because we were able to show that the conclusion follows logically from the premises. But the argument is not sound because the premise that all water bottles are plastic is not true. There are many versions of glass and metal bottles that are evidence that the first premise is not true. This argument is valid but not sound.    From the first premise we know that all firefighters lie inside the set of those who know CPR (firefighters are a subset of people who know CPR). From the second premise, we know that Jill is a member of the set of those who know CPR, but we do not have enough information to know whether she is also a member of set of firefighters.    A set diagram with the circle for the set of firefighters contained within the set of those who know CPR. Both are in the universal set rectangle; There is a question mark inside the firefighter circle and in the larger know CPR region because we don't know which region Jill is in    Since we cannot determine which group Jill must be a part of, the argument is invalid. The statement that Jill is a firefighter does not follow logically from the premises that all firefighters know CPR and that Jill knows CPR . Since the argument is not valid, it cannot be sound.      A set diagram with 2 disjoint sets, people who like to dance and my friends; Both circles are in the universal set rectangle; There is a question mark in the my friends circle and in the region outside the circles because we don't know where Kai goes.    Because it said none we draw disjoint sets – one set for my friends and a second set for people who like to dance. The second premise tells us that Kai doesn't like to dance so they're not in the set of people who like to dance. However, we can't put Kai in the set of my friends either. They could be my friend, or someone I don't know who happens to not like dancing. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid . And therefore, the arguement is also not sound .      A set diagram with 2 overlapping sets, young adults and minimum wage earners; There is a question mark in the young adults region and in the intersection of the two circles because we don't know where Tara goes.    Because it said some we draw overlapping sets. The second premise tells us to put Tara in the set of young adults, but it doesn't tell us if she makes minimum wage or not. So, like the previous example we cannot determine which region she is in. She could make minimum wage, or she could also make more. Therefore, the conclusion is not valid and therefore, not sound .      "

  "title": "Logical Fallacies",
  "body": " Logical Fallacies   Logical Fallacies.   Students will be able to:     Identify common logical fallacies and their use in arguments      Logical Fallacies  In the last section we saw that logical arguments are invalid when the premises are not sufficient to guarantee the conclusion, and that even if an argument is valid it may be unsound if the premises are not true. There are other ways that a logical argument my by invalid or unsound. One of the more common ways this can occur is if the argument is a fallacy .  A fallacy is a type of argument that appears valid but uses a logical error to persuade or deceive. Fallacious arguments are especially common in advertising and politics, so it is important as informed citizens to recognize when we are being presented with a fallacious argument and to not be persuaded by it.    Common Logical Fallacies  There are many logical fallacies, and some go by more than one name. Below we introduce a few of the more common fallacies that you will be asked to recognize by name, but there are many others.    Personal Attack (Ad hominem)  A personal attack argument attacks the person making the argument while ignoring the argument itself. A personal attack is not the same as an insult. Rather, a personal attack claims that there is something wrong with the person or group in order to cast doubt on their character and discredit their argument.    Jane says that whales are fish, but she's only in the second grade so she can't be right.   Here the argument is attacking Jane, not the validity of her claim, so this is a personal attack.     Jane says that whales are fish, but everyone knows that they're really mammals. She's so stupid.   This certainly isn't very nice, but it is not a personal attack since a valid counterargument is made ( they really are mammals ) along with a personal insult.     Mr. Smith is a college dropout, so his stance on education reform cannot be trusted.   Here the argument uses the fact that Mr. Smith did not complete their college degree to discredit their ideas on education reform, so it is a personal attack.     Appeal to Ignorance  An appeal to ignorance argument assumes something is true because it hasn't been proven false.    Nobody has proven that photo isn't of Bigfoot, so it must be Bigfoot.   This is an example of an appeal to ignorance since the fact that no one has been able to prove the picture of Bigfoot is false is being used as evidence that it is Bigfoot.     Appeal to Authority  An appeal to authority argument attempts to use the authority of a person to prove a claim. An authority could be an expert such as a doctor or scholar, or someone who is admired like a celebrity or sports figure. While an authority can provide strength to an argument, problems can occur when the person's opinion is not shared by other experts, or when the authority is irrelevant to the claim.    A diet high in bacon can be healthy; Doctor Atkins said so.   Here, an appeal to a doctor's authority is used for the argument. This generally would provide strength to the argument, except that the opinion that eating a diet high in saturated fat runs counter to general medical opinion. More supporting evidence would be needed to justify this claim.     Jennifer Hudson and Oprah lost weight with Weight Watchers, so their program must work.   In this example there is an appeal to the authority of celebrities. While their experience does provide evidence, it provides no more than any other person's experience would.     False Dilemma  A false dilemma argument falsely frames an argument as an either or choice without allowing for additional options.    Either those lights in the sky were an airplane or aliens. There are no airplanes scheduled for tonight, so it must be aliens.   This argument is a false dilemma since it ignores the possibility that the lights could be something other than an airplane or aliens.     Straw Man (or Straw Person)  A straw person argument involves misrepresenting the argument in an oversimplified, distorted and less favorable way to make it easier to attack.    Senator Khouri has proposed reducing military spending by 10%. Apparently, she wants to leave us defenseless against attacks by terrorists.   Here the arguer has represented a 10% funding cut as equivalent to leaving us defenseless, making it easier to attack Senator Khouri's position.     Post Hoc  A post hoc argument claims that because two things happened sequentially, then the first must have caused the second.    Every morning the rooster crows just before dawn. It must be his crow that makes the sun rise.   Here the arguer is saying the rooster caused the sun to rise, but it is more likely that the sun rising caused the rooster to crow.     Today I wore a red shirt and my football team won! I need to wear a red shirt every time they play to make sure they keep winning.   This person is saying their team won because they wore a red shirt. This type of superstition is quite common in sports even though we really know they are unrelated.   Sometimes there may be more than one fallacy that seems reasonable. Consider this argument: Emma Watson says she's a feminist, but she posed for these racy pictures. I'm a feminist and no self-respecting feminist would do that. Could this be ad hominem, saying that Emma Watson has no self-respect? Could it be appealing to authority because the person making the argument claims to be a feminist? Could it be a false dilemma because the argument assumes that a woman is either a feminist or not, with no gray area in between?  We have described just six of the many types of logical fallacies. Once you learn to recognize these you will also likely become aware of many others. There are many lists of logical fallacies online.    Exercises    Determine which type of fallacy each argument represents.    John Bardeen's work at the Advanced Institute for Physics has progressed so slowly that even his colleagues call him a plodder. Hence, it is prudent at present not to take seriously his current theory relating how strings constitute the smallest of subatomic particles.   Personal attack    You will tell the general manager that I made the right choice in dealing with that customer. After all, I'm the shift manager, so my decisions are always right.   Appeal to authority    It was his fault, Officer. You can tell by the kind of car I'm driving and by my clothes that I am a good citizen and would not lie. Look at the rattletrap he is driving and look at how he is dressed. You can't believe anything a dirty, longhaired hippie like that might tell you. Search his car; he probably has pot in it.   Personal Dilemma    We can go to the amusement park or the library. The amusement park is too expensive, so we must go to the library.   False dilemma    Nearly all heroin addicts used marijuana before trying heroin. Clearly marijuana use leads to heroin addiction.   Post Hoc    The oven was working fine until you started using it, so you must have broken it.   Post Hoc    Old man Brown claims that he saw a flying saucer in his farm, but he never got beyond the fourth grade in school and can hardly read or write. He is completely ignorant of what scientists have written on the subject, so his report cannot possibly be true.   Personal Attack    You should use Sparkle brand toothpaste since four out of five dentists recommend it.   Appeal to authority    She didn't say that I couldn't borrow her car, so I figured it was fine if I borrowed it for the weekend.   Appeal to ignorance    If you think that teens should be taught about contraceptive measures then you want to give kids license to have sex with no consequences.   Straw person    You're either part of the solution or part of the problem.   False dilemma    No one can prove that God exists, therefore God does not exist.   Appeal to ignorance    You're clearly just too young to understand.   Personal attack    You should start off every morning with Champions brand cereal. It is what Michael Jordan eats, so you know that it must be very good for you.   Appeal to authority    No one on the council objected to the idea that he proposed, so everyone must think it is a good idea.   Appeal to ignorance    Why should we believe your testimony? You haven't had a steady job since 2003.   Personal attack    A huge percentage of diagnosed cases of autism came very soon after vaccinations for the measles. These vaccinations must be causing autism.   Post Hoc    If you are against this war then you must hate America.   Straw person    Just look at her face. How could anyone vote for that?   Personal Attack     There are a number of fallacies that were not discussed in this section. Do an internet search for the following fallacies. Provide both a definition and at least one example.   Slippery Slope    Circular Reasoning    Appeal to Emotion    Red Herring    Whataboutism      Answers will vary.    "
